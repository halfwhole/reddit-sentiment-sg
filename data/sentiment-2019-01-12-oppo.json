It favors the most cost effective solutions to a low carbon future, whether that be a greater BEVs proportion, public transport, or a straight up reduction in consumption. Again, I'm not against decarbonization, I'm against artificially selecting and promoting one technology over others on the taxpayer's dime. If it turns out the BEVs are the most cost effective way to decarbonize, then the market will select it because the total lifetime costs+taxes will be lowest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause EVs isn't simply about removing carbon in the air. Climate change is the major driver for adopting EVs but there are other benefits too, including:\n\n* Increased energy efficiency from EVs. Traditional internal combustion engines (ICE) are around 30% efficient for petrol and up to 45% for diesel. EVs are around 60% efficient taking into account power generation and grid distribution losses. That 1.3 to 2 time the efficiency. Energy needed to power 1 petrol ICE car can power 2 EVs\n* Reduction in other atmospheric pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, ground level ozone, particulate matter, etc. The latter of which has been proven in multiple studies (just look up my post history) to have adverse health effects including raising the risks of heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and stroke.\n* Reduction in noise pollution. Recent studies again link chronic noise exposure to heart disease - of which traffic noise is a substantial portion\n\nBeyond that, I need to categorically state that I do not believe that EVs are the singular solution. In fact, they are simply one component in a modern, clean and efficient transportation system. We will need to invest more in public mass transit since that is the most efficient, but it is a no brainer for governments to invest in EV infrastructure since:\n\n* Low (private) car numbers doesn't mean no (private) cars - to borrow from SPF\n* There will still be a need for taxis and good vehicles which make up 43% of emissions: They will need to be addressed. Even if you can hypothetically eliminate all taxis, good vehicles still make up almost one-fifth of emissions. That is definitely not an insubstantial proportion.\n\n&gt;I do, because the charging infrastructure is distinct from public transport in that there are few economies of scale. It is scalable enough that private individuals can afford a low duty cycle charger just for their homes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is precisely because there are poor economies of scale that we require government investment. The overarching philosophy here is that it makes little financial sense for the individual or small business to start such an endeavour; but broad adoption spurred by government kickstarting will bring about substantial benefits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExamples of this in the local context into solar power generation via PV cells (with EMA grants) and diversification of water supply through NEWater and desalination (with MEWR grants).\n\nIt would never have been cost efficient for a small company to build a reverse osmosis plant in order to save water - but doing it on a massive scale because our government recognise a deficit worked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Your solution is to intervene directly by provisioning. I prefer that we intervene through taxing pollution, and letting the markets provision green technology that would be most cost effective after taxation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFiscal penalties and incentives are not the answer to all our problems.

Undischarged bankrupts are not allowed to contest in an election.\n\n&gt; Mr Lim was secretary-general of the National Solidarity Party between 2015 and 2017, before founding a new party called People\u2019s Voice. It was registered as the country\u2019s 11th political party on Oct 31 last year.\n\n&gt; A hearing for Mr Lim\u2019s bankruptcy application, brought by Shanghai-based businessman Huang Min, is scheduled for Thursday morning. TODAY understands that if the loan is repaid by then, Mr Huang may\u00a0withdraw the application.\n\n&gt; The hearing for Mr Lim\u2019s appeal on Tuesday, which was held behind closed doors, was over in eight minutes.\n\n&gt; Asked for an update as he walked out of the courtroom, Mr Lim, who is a lawyer and representing himself, said: \u201cNo comment.\u201d\n\n&gt; He was first ordered to repay Mr Huang last August by the District Court\u2019s deputy registrar Regina Lim. Mr Lim appealed but District Judge Tan May Tee reaffirmed the decision on Nov 22, saying Mr Lim had not produced documents to support his claims.\n\n&gt; Mr Huang\u2019s lawyer also declined to comment.\n\n&gt; TODAY understands that Mr Lim had written to the Supreme Court earlier on Tuesday, and the hearing was solely for Justice Chan Seng Onn to grant permission to withdraw the appeal.\n\n&gt; In December after the bankruptcy application was filed, Mr Lim had said he would contest it.\n\n&gt; Under Singapore law, a bankruptcy application can be filed by a creditor as long as the amount owed is no less than S$15,000.\n\n&gt; Court documents show Mr Huang agreed to provide a loan to Mr Lim on Sept 13, 2013. Both men signed an agreement, which stipulated that the loan be repaid by Nov 30 that year. Mr Lim had sought the loan because of a \u201cpersonal capital requirement\u201d, the agreement stated.\n\n&gt; Mr Huang transferred the US$150,000 to Mr Lim on Sept 17 and things soured when the deadline passed without repayment.\n\n&gt; According to Mr Lim, the money was not a loan but a \u201cdownpayment for a cargo of iron ore\u201d that Mr Huang\u2019s company had wanted to buy from his firm.\n\n&gt; Mr Lim has been operating an iron ore mine in Central Sulawesi since 2011 through an Indonesian company, PT Ina Touna Mining, which he controlled.\n\n&gt; In his affidavit, Mr Lim claimed that Mr Huang had agreed to a downpayment to show his \u201cseriousness and commitment\u201d. The downpayment was classified as a personal loan for administrative reasons at Mr Huang\u2019s request, he said.\n\n&gt; Mr Huang\u2019s lawyer said his client did express interest in buying iron ore from Mr Lim, but it was separate from the loan agreement and did not eventually materialise.\n\n&gt; District Judge Tan ruled that Mr Lim did not adequately support his assertions that the money was a downpayment.\n\n&gt; Mr Lim provided no supporting documents to show that both parties had reached an agreement regarding the sale and purchase of iron ore, and he acknowledged the loan in one of his emails to Mr Huang, she added.\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n0.3.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "author": "rsg-retrivr", "created_utc": 1547554539, "score": 0.9925}, {"body": "This is the guy trying to sue the PM for that blogger guy right.

Some do not even send their children to school, forcing  teachers to have to make house visits, or cause their children to miss  school repeatedly when they themselves oversleep.\n\nIn other cases, children may be enrolled in extra reading programmes  conducted by the school or in MOE's learning support programme, but  their progress is stymied as their parents do not help them with reading  exercises.\n\nMs Lenny's bottom-line message to such parents is this: They need to  put in some effort if they want to help their kids break out of the  poverty cycle or reach their fullest potential. \"I'm not saying that  it's a parent's responsibility to teach a child. If not, we teachers  will be out of a job. They say that it takes a village to raise a child,  and if I'm the only villager then it will be very difficult,\" she said,  adding that teachers' efforts at helping pupils will just go to waste  if parents do not follow up with their children at home.\n\nMs Lenny also does not buy the argument that parents juggling  multiple shift jobs have no time to spare to read with their children.  They can start with reading simple books to their children for just 10  minutes a few times a week, she said.\n\nLearning to read is important, Ms Lenny said, as it will affect one's  ability to do maths word problems or answer science questions down the  road. \"In most cases, a child will just keep having to play catch up,  while still trying to learn new things at the same time, and end up  getting stuck in a vicious circle.\"\n\n\ud83d\udcf7   Related Story \n\n#### [Primary school pupils in Singapore second in global reading literacy study](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/primary-school-pupils-in-singapore-take-second-place-in-global-benchmarking)\n\n  Related Story \n\n#### [Engage children while reading to them: Experts](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/engage-children-while-reading-to-them-experts)\n\n  Related Story \n\n#### [New initiative aims to encourage reading among less-privileged children](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-initiative-aims-to-encourage-reading-among-less-privileged-children)\n\n  Related Story \n\n#### [Reading broadens your child's mind](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/reading-broadens-your-childs-mind)\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "author": "Jammy_buttons", "created_utc": 1548636671, "score": -0.6598}, {"body": "They said a [bear](https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/48b/c4/8d0c04b606c49546.jpg) owns that bike.", "author": "SpermWhale", "created_utc": 1548639434, "score": 0.0}, {"body": "Barisan Socialis is a socialist party, became Workers Party", "author": "Singaporeanatwork", "created_utc": 1548640433, "score": 0.6597}, {"body": "Regardless of who we support I think we should put the country and the people's interests first.

There\u2019s no such study that I\u2019m aware of and it\u2019s pretty difficult to prove that all esteemed economist are doing what you are saying. Pretty hard to prove a negative. \n\nOn the other hand, I can simply point to Paul Krugman who has used similar approach to whatever I\u2019ve said + Yeoh Lam Keong ex GIC chief economist who agrees that Singapore income gap is increasing. \n\nI did name drop Yeoh previously, but personally I think name dropping is quite pointless because this is not a competition of \u201cmy economist is better than yours\u201d, but I think the line needs to be drawn when the other party such as you is not even wanting to be at the table of discussion and simply put your fingers in your ears saying \u201clalala\u201d. \n\nSo to recap, what we\u2019ve done so far \n\n1) I said rich poor gap increased in my original comment \n\n2) you came and respond how people keep thinking income gap is increasing \n\n2) I linked a website that showed stats where income is gap is increasing in absolute terms\n\n3) you refuse to acknowledge that income gap is increasing in absolute terms and asked for source when I said it is increasing in absolute terms\n\n4) I showed you the original picture from the original link with source quoted \n\n5) you changes goal post and now it becomes absolute (and real terms) are inconsequential\n\n6) all the while throwing insults and acting smug throughout the whole ordeal. \n\nYou know the funny thing? I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a right/wrong issue. But to you it\u2019s machiam \u201cI am right and everybody else who think otherwise is stupid\u201d\n\nAll I can say is I\u2019m sad it has devolved to this, but I\u2019m not surprised. There is a study from US that showed that middle income folks are more political conservative and hate taxes and socialism policies despite them being closer to the lower income group compared to the higher income group. A theory put forth was that these people have aspirations to be rich themselves and hence they want to protect the institutions that favor the rich even though they would have benefited more from socialism policies. \n\nI have no doubt this factor may be prevalent in Singapore which is even more conservative compared to the states. Already we have so few rich people championing cause for the lower income, as there really is no need for them who are thriving in this current setup to short change themselves.\n\nWhich is why I admire Yeoh because he is obviously rich (ex-GIC leh) and he know his stuff to actually enjoy the current system long beyond his death. However he is championing more socialism. Beyond the moral factor of fair distribution, there is actually good economic reasons why increasing lower income wages and stronger safety nets may be better for Singapore to encourage healthier growth and more entrepreneurs to come out due to lower cost of failures. But don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be interested in stupid ideas like this. \n\nFWIW, I don\u2019t belong to the 1%, but I pay net tax rate of 25% in Singapore which puts me around top 5%. I have spoken to many of my peers before about economic reforms and I understand the pushback for them. It\u2019s not fun to pay higher taxes and they\u2019ll pay even more. What I find amusing is whenever I talk to middle/lower income groups and I encounter pushback I do wonder why I wanna help push/vote for reforms that will make me pay even more taxes and benefit them more and then face opposition from the same people. \n\nIf you belong to the rich, I can understand your refusal to even acknowledge simple facts and resistance to have a discussion. But you need to see whether current setup is really sustainable for society as a whole. If it\u2019s not sustainable, then our position at the top is also at risk. \n\nIf you are not, then I will just plead for you to stop sabotaging yourself. \n\nCheers ", "author": "steamkuaypng", "created_utc": 1550188990, "score": 0.9969}, {"body": "prior to 2000, we had the Endurance class LSTs, MCVs, MGBs, PV/APVs, and MCMVs.", "author": "n1ghth0und", "created_utc": 1550198158, "score": 0.0}, {"body": "1 LST, no MCxx, PV has no galley?", "author": "highdiver_2000", "created_utc": 1550207288, "score": -0.5267}, {"body": "what do you mean PV has no galley? where do you think we cook? lol. the PV galley is right next to the stairs leading up to the bridge.\n\nMCVs were commissioned in 1990/1991, MCMVs were commissioned in 1995.

Among them are five MPs and eight  assemblymen who have refused to take up residence in existing Sabah  parties. Then, it was revealed that the Premier had brokered a deal to  obtain the backing of Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) to fend off any  possible internal coup against him.\n\n\"If DAP, Keadilan, Amanah betray and are no longer loyal to the  country, I will switch to other parties. We are mobile, we are not  fixed,\" Dr Mahathir said when welcoming seven former Umno MPs - who quit  the scandal-hit party after it lost power in last May's general  election - into PPBM last Tuesday.\n\nThe reference to PH allies, the Democratic Action Party, Parti  Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and Parti Amanah Negara, at first appeared to be  hypothetical, to justify taking in leaders of the previous long-ruling  Umno-led Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.\n\nBut now it seems to be akin to a warning shot across the bow, after  PAS officials began referring publicly to rumours of a vote of  no-confidence in Dr Mahathir's leadership. The Islamist party has become  a fierce rival to erstwhile allies, DAP as well as PKR president Anwar  Ibrahim, who is waiting to become premier, according to PH's transition  plan, albeit one without an official firm timeline.\n\nPAS secretary-general Takiyuddin Hassan said a \"sample\" letter of  support given to Dr Mahathir - which the PM affirmed - during a Friday  meeting with the Islamist party's president, Mr Abdul Hadi Awang, was to  indicate \"backing\" only in the event of \"a vote of no confidence\".\n\n\"We know Parliament will resume in March, and this began with Dr  Mahathir's statement. Tun mentioned it (betrayal) and politicians  understand,\" the PAS secretary-general said on Sunday.\n\nDatuk Seri Anwar, for his part, has denied the existence of any plan  for a coup, dismissing the allegation as \"a PAS attempt to deflect the  focus on the money taken from 1MDB\". The PKR leader, who only last week  said he expected to be prime minister in two years, was referring to a  probe into allegations that PAS leaders received RM90 million (S$30  million) from Umno prior to last year's general election.\n\nTwo PKR vice-presidents and several DAP leaders have publicly rebuked  PPBM for the \"betrayal\" in accepting former Umno \"rubbish\".\n\n \n\nOther PH members in Sabah, who have backed the chief minister and  president of the Warisan party, Datuk Seri Shafie Apdal, have expressed  shock at the PPBM move, with Luyang assemblyman Phoong Jin Zhe  denouncing it as \"a stab in the back\".\n\nBut, in a short statement yesterday, Mr Shafie chose not to rebuke  PPBM although he pointed out that Sabahans gave his \"Parti Warisan Sabah  the mandate to govern... they were fed up with the Umno-BN government  and wanted a change for the better\".\n\nDr Mahathir, 93, returned to power after PH's shock win in the polls  last May 9, but his party made up only 13 of the 122 MPs in PH and Parti  Warisan Sabah. PPBM's strength, however, has now grown to 22 MPs, with  at least five more set to join in Sabah. At this juncture, the majority  of the MPs from Dr Mahathir's party would have won their seats as Umno  members.\n\nSingapore Institute of International Affairs senior fellow Oh Ei Sun  told The Straits Times that Dr Mahathir \"is not happy that he is  constrained by DAP and PKR\", which collectively have 92 MPs.\n\n\"So he is broadening PH. This does not mean he wants to stay on  forever, but that his legacy must stay forever. Of course, this also  checkmates Anwar, so he is killing two birds with one stone,\" Mr Oh  said.\n\nNot all of Dr Mahathir's PH partners are upset at an expanding PPBM.  PKR deputy president Azmin Ali, who leads a rival faction to Mr Anwar in  the party, said the defecting Umno leaders \"can go to the ground and  meet Umno members to explain the need to leave their rotten party\".\n\nMr Eekmal Ahmad, special officer to PKR's Selangor chief minister,  also said those criticising Dr Mahathir's \"consolidation of power... do  not understand political dynamics\" of the crucial Malay majority. \"PKR  or Bersatu are all in Harapan.

KCCV had been aware of the intended purpose of the booking, which was for SDP's election campaign launch.\n\n&gt; Related Story SDP and JTC trade words over cancellation of the political party's campaign launch venue\n\n&gt; The booking was then cancelled because KCCV had not obtained prior approval from the building landlord and the KCCV board, which came to know of the booking only on Friday.\n\n&gt; KCCV also said that it, through an e-mail from a company employee to the SDP, wrongly attributed the cancellation to a JTC inspection.\n\n&gt; A KCCV spokesman told The Straits Times that its staff had not sought prior approval from the building landlord and the KCCV board in spite of the event being a politically-related one.\n\n&gt; \"The event was not in the regular course of KCCV's business, as typical events that are hosted at the venue would include video and audio recordings, panel interviews, music and vocal training, and post-production work, among others,\" he added.\n\n&gt; He said that events not in line with KCCV's regular course of business \"ought to be brought up to the building landlord and KCCV's board of directors\".\n\n&gt; The SLV Hub space is located at 115 Eunos Avenue 3, which is a multi-storey complex known as the Zhaolim Building. The building is owned by Zhaolim Pte Ltd.\n\n&gt; According to the statement, the KCCV employee and manager have been counselled. Guidelines and controls have also been put in place to ensure that a similar situation does not happen again.\n\n&gt; KCCV has contacted the SDP to apologise and will be refunding SDP's full payment. It added that it has offered to pay the difference between the rental that SDP had to pay at an alternative venue and the original rental cost for KCCV's premises, as well as the cancellation fee of SDP's caterer.\n\n&gt; The company has also written to JTC to apologise.\n\n&gt; SDP said on its website on Tuesday that it accepted KCCV's apology and considered the matter closed.

It said it was monitoring the situation.\n\nURA said if the purchaser needs more time to exercise the OTP, he or  the developer can apply to the Controller of Housing for an extension of  the validity period by up to eight weeks from the date of OTP.\n\n\"This period will be sufficient for the purchaser to make the  necessary arrangements to exercise the OTP, e.g. obtain a bank loan,\"  the URA spokesman said.\n\n\"To ensure the accuracy of our data, we have started to make  adjustments to the monthly developers' sales figures from January 2019  to account for lapsed OTPs that were declared by developers to URA.\"\n\nAsked about the report, Mr Chng Chee Beow, executive director of  Logan Property Singapore, the joint developer of Stirling Residences,  said: \"If there is a genuine buyer, we will extend the OTP. Some  developers may allow extensions up to two or three times.\"\n\nMr Chia Ngiang Hong, City Developments' group general manager, said:  \"To date, 262 OTPs have been issued (for Whistler Grand) and more than  half have been exercised, with the rest progressively to be exercised.\n\n\"As with most projects, OTPs typically lapsed or were re-issued due  to various reasons such as (buyers') change of mind, request for  addition and/or deletion of name, or change of unit. Moreover,  (following the cooling measures), some home buyers including HDB  upgraders required more time to arrange their finances and loans.\"\n\nMr Chia said the adjustment URA made to reflect the actual number of  units sold is a positive move that provides greater accuracy and  prevents misunderstanding of the sales data.", "author": "Jammy_buttons", "created_utc": 1551317422, "score": 0.9915}, {"body": "There is already a hidden minimum wage.

Let me explain:\n\nWhen streaming was introduced the country faced an imminent dilemma - standardized testing was causing large failure rates for a population with very diverse education preconditions. There were significant drop out rates. Something needed to change and education success countries like Germany had successfully implemented streaming (at pri 4!) to combat similar structural challenges below. \n\nMoving to subject based banding could have been considered but large class sizes and a limited pool of teachers along with a generally lower expertise level across those teachers would have likely caused it to fail. \n\nSo streaming was introduced and overall produced the results it desired. Singapore is world class when it comes to education today. Not perfect but no country is. \n\nToday, in a generally high standard of education environment moving to banding promises with further optimization by avoiding mis-streaming and better personalization. With much stronger and versatile teacher training and significantly better teacher: student rates in 2024, it has a reasonable chance of success. \n\nSingapore by far does not get enough credit for it's agility in adjusting to reality and being able to sacrifice core systems like streaming. \n \nMost governments and populations on the planet, especially in the western world have lost their ability to make such sweeping changes as populations age and people get accustomed to how things have always been. \n\nThe government should be commended that they are willing to take this risk , not ridiculed for having the country walk first before. \n\nBut that's not what the meme conveys. It instead tries to tell the story of a guy who was right 40 years ago and had his idea stolen later. It tries to paint the ability to adjust to reality as a bad thing, instead pushing the expectations that politics should be about dogmatically sticking to ones view points instead of pragmatically acting as the times requesting. \n\nIt's longing for the failing western tribal / left right model where people sort themselves into camps who have their fixed view on the world and never change it even in the face of error or changing external circumstances. \n\nI get it, it would be so much easier for people longing for more opposition to have camps and dogma like this instead of a government smoothly adjusting whenever they see pressure or potential for change.\n\nBut in many ways this is how Singapore works. Opposition creates pressure to adjust and the government at times relieves that pressure by change. Most countries could only dream of such a pragmatic approach in their crusted camp structure. \n\nSo by all means, share this meme if you want to misinform and score points with people longing for simplicity and reinforcement of their existing viewpoints. But I don't think you would like the outcome if politics in this country becomes reduced to this. \n", "author": "Tarrasque888", "created_utc": 1551964446, "score": 0.9495}, {"body": "The quote in panel 1 contains no policy ideas.

Some said that they will\u00a0not give their consent.\n\n&gt; THE ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n&gt; The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday that it will offer HPV vaccination for free to female students in Sec 1, or the equivalent, from April. Female students who are now in Sec 2 to 5 will also be offered the vaccination as a one-off \u201ccatch-up\u201d measure.\n\n&gt; About 200 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed yearly from 2011 to 2015, and around 70 people die of the disease every year.\n\n&gt; HPV is mainly transmitted through sexual contact, and cervical cancer is caused by sexually acquired infection with certain types of HPV. Vaccination costs at least S$300 for the three shots required over six months.\n\n&gt; MIXED REACTIONS FROM PARENTS\n\n&gt; Some parents approached by TODAY are not in favour of their daughters getting HPV vaccination, while others wanted more information.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Read also\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Key source of artificial trans fat to be banned: MOH\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Ms Sakunthala Jackson, who has a 15-year-old daughter, said that she will\u00a0not allow her daughter to get vaccinated.\n\n&gt; \u201cI have already educated my daughter on sex\u00a0and I am still educating her,\u201d said the 45-year-old homemaker. \u201cFurthermore, I feel that by allowing this vaccination, it is like giving children the permission to (engage in sexual relations) since they are already \u2018protected\u2019. I feel that both she and her partner have to be faithful in their relationship in order to avoid HPV (infection).\u201d\n\n&gt; Civil servant Vincent Ong, who has two daughters aged 10 and seven, said\u00a0he would have preferred that MOH made\u00a0the vaccination compulsory. In this way, he will\u00a0not have to give permission, which could seem like he is giving his daughters the \u201cgreen light\u201d to engage in sex earlier,\u00a0the 41-year-old said.\n\n&gt; Another parent, who wanted to be known only as Ms Vijyah, said that she will\u00a0encourage her 15-year-old daughter to get vaccinated but wanted more information on how long the vaccine will last and its possible side effects.\n\n&gt; Mr Ong Ching Chye, 44, is also in favour of his three daughters aged six to 12 getting vaccinated. He called for\u00a0MOH to issue a question-and-answer on the HPV vaccine.\n\n&gt; \u201cYou only know what the vaccination is about after research. There is not a lot of information that is readily available. It will\u00a0be good if parents can\u00a0be informed of the benefits of the vaccination,\u201d he said.\n\n&gt; \u2018INFORM US THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA\u2019\n\n&gt; Several teenage girls said that they did not know what HPV or cervical cancer is, and that it may be awkward to raise the topic with their parents.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Read also\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; New green Chas card from November for all Singaporeans with chronic health conditions\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \u201c(My parents) will\u00a0ask me if there is something wrong with me, and ask why I need\u00a0to get it,\u201d said Ayuni Insyirah, 15, who is interested in getting vaccinated.\n\n&gt; Caron Priscilla, also 15, said that she is unlikely to get vaccinated because\u00a0she does not plan on being sexually active until marriage.\n\n&gt; Navina Nadaraj, 15, said that the authorities could use social media to raise awareness on HPV and the vaccine.\n\n&gt; VACCINE DOESN\u2019T CHANGE SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR, DOCS SAY\n\n&gt; Doctors are wholly in support of the vaccination exercise and seek\u00a0to debunk myths surrounding its implications.\n\n&gt; Dr Joseph Ng, president of the Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology of Singapore, said: \u201cParents think that if you vaccinate, that\u2019s going to give their kids licence to be sexually promiscuous. However, that\u2019s been shown to be untrue in the United States. We know (the vaccine) doesn\u2019t change sexual behaviour at all.\u201d\u00a0\n\n&gt; Most parents have \u201cno qualms\u201d about vaccinating their children against Hepatitis B, which can be sexually transmitted and cause cancer, he said.\n\n&gt; Associate Professor Chong Chia Yin, senior consultant at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital, said: \u201cThe fact is that there is no evidence that boys and girls who receive the vaccine have sex earlier than those who do not have the vaccine, nor do they have more sexual partners once they become sexually active.\u201d\u00a0\n\n&gt; Dr June Goh, president of the Singapore Council of Women\u2019s Organisations, said that the move will\u00a0benefit women\u2019s health on a national level and help in the prevention of cervical cancer, which is \u201ca potentially devastating malignancy\u201d.\n\n&gt; While HPV vaccines have been offered here for over\u00a0a decade, a study published in 2017 by SingHealth Polyclinics showed that uptake and awareness is low.\n\n&gt; This could be due to its cost and a fear of needles among people, said Professor Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases specialist and president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection.\n\n&gt; \u201cMany young people do not think that they will be at risk of cancer many years later, or know that there is a vaccine which can prevent that,\u201d he added.\n\n&gt; Encouraging those eligible to opt in, Prof Tambyah said: \u201cThere are not many things in Singapore which are free. Hopefully, this will persuade many parents to get their girls vaccinated to protect them from cervical cancer.\u201d ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY WONG PEI TING\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n0.5.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "author": "rsg-retrivr", "created_utc": 1552003139, "score": 0.9041}, {"body": "The organiser could do some fundraiser thing to cover his costs like the Workers' Party did.", "author": "goondoo7", "created_utc": 1552020562, "score": 0.6369}, {"body": "just sucks that there isn't enough opposition around too\n\nthe govt is getting very complacent", "author": "CalyceGG", "created_utc": 1552025057, "score": -0.4754}, {"body": "I went to check out sdp's website regarding their education proposal on 'streaming'.

But there are still people who are house- and neighbourhood-proud who are willing to share their stories,\u201d said Lim.\n\n&gt; While preparing for Potong Pasir, Tan recalled how one participating artist, Hafiz Osman, distributed flyers telling people he wanted to paint their walls for free.\n\n&gt; \u201cAnd a lot of them were super suspicious of him! But the ones who said yes were those who hadn\u2019t upgraded their homes for 30 years, and he had an amazing opportunity to talk to these people and see their homes that hadn\u2019t changed much in 30 years,\u201d she said.\n\n&gt; THE OCCASIONAL PROPERTY AGENT\n\n&gt; And what of OH! guests \u2013 do they really go to these tours to look at art? Or are they simply kaypoh about other people\u2019s houses?\n\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s both,\u201d said Oei. \u201cBy and large, majority go for the art and also learn about the stories in the neighbourhoods \u2013 there\u2019s a hunger among Singaporeans to connect to these stories.\u201d\n\n&gt; That said, there are some attendees who really just want to see the houses. \u201cDuring the Emerald Hill walk, there will be people who\u2019ll come to us specifically asking which tour goes to the houses,\u201d said Lim.\n\n&gt; \u201cAnd for Potong Pasir, there was actually a property agent who came because she was more interested in the houses \u2013 she wanted to go into bedrooms and wanted to open cabinets. Our guide really gave it to her!\u201d she shared, but added that the majority of visitors are usually very polite.\n\n&gt; \u201cThey self-police and sort of have like a \u2018class monitor\u2019 who\u2019ll say you\u2019re not supposed to do this or that.\u201d\n\n&gt; And given the foot traffic and logistical nightmare of people moving around a home, it\u2019s perhaps a surprise that only one mishap has taken place. Way\u00a0back during the Marine Parade edition, a guest broke a vase.\n\n&gt; \u201cBut it was meant to be. The vase was from the homeowner\u2019s ex-boyfriend,\u201d quipped Lim.\n\n&gt; BEYOND NEIGHBOURHOODS\n\n&gt; After arguably popularising this kind of tour format, OH! is slowly changing its strategy\u00a0\u2013 last year\u2019s Emerald Hill edition was the last \u201cneighbourhood\u201d tour.\n\n&gt; Beginning next year, OH! tours won\u2019t be revolving around places but starting a new trilogy of tours that looks at the themes of \u201cwood, earth and water\u201d. For 2020, said Oei, it will be \u201cwood\u201d and audiences can go explore a timber\u00a0factory and there are plans to work with carpenters and furniture makers.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, this year\u2019s OH! events have become more intimate. For a new ongoing series called Singapore Calendar, a select group of participants gets to interact and follow an artist as he or she creates a work, which culminates in a final exhibition.\n\n&gt; This month, there\u2019s also an event called Passport, where artists actually collaborate closely with a homeowner to create something for audiences to see. And it\u2019s not just in one neighbourhood \u2013 these pop-up experiences are spread around places such as Telok Blangah, Marsiling and Tanjong Pagar.\n\n&gt; Said Oei: \u201cOur Singaporean houseowners are much more adventurous than we give them credit for. They might be performing, leading tours or taking questions \u2013 we wanted them to be involved in a much bigger way.\u201d\n\n&gt; For more details about OH!

Although the target audience was mainly for other train buffs, it was a long process of finding \"scenes\" of how to paint our own train network in a different light, and at angles people never tend to look at trains from. Of course there were many limitations and challenges faced while producing this, as it is an unwritten rule that no photography is allowed on the MRT network, and that pointing a camera at trains basically makes you a suspicious person.\n\nPeople do ask me why I did this video and lots of stuff about my hobby which I struggle to explain, but I can only say it's me, and it's the passion that drives me (and other train buffs) to do these things in our hobby.

The issue is a point of contention in the free trade agreement between the EU and Australia.\n\nIpos stressed that Singapore's regime does not follow the EU's, and it will make its own determinations on applications to its GI registry.\n\nSimilar to the existing trademark registration, opponents can contest applications for various reasons, such as a name having become generic in the Singapore context.\n\nSuch opposition can delay the start date of enhanced protection by nearly a year, ST understands.\n\nMr Lam Chung Nian, a WongPartnership partner who specialises in intellectual property cases, warned against making any groundless threats or frivolous claims, which can result in legal action.\n\nThe head of intellectual property, sports and gaming at the Rajah &amp; Tann law firm, Mr Lau Kok Keng, said that for now, impor-ters of food products, wines and spirits will have to review and adjust their operations to comply with the new requirements.\n\nThis means ceasing import of affected products under their original names.

In view of strong interest from retail investors, the size of the public offer was increased from $115 million to $329 million. Hyflux's directors, management and employees were allocated $6 million and the remaining $165 million placed out.\n\n&gt; The Straits Times understands that MAS was responding to queries Bloomberg had made in relation to a letter by Mr Leong Mun Wai published on March 26 in The Business Times.\n\n&gt; In the letter, Mr Leong had said that \"financial analysts of the financial institutions who sold the perpetual securities should have anticipated the financial risks to unsophisticated CPF investors when the securities were issued in 2016, because by then, the electricity price had collapsed.\"\n\n&gt; Mr Leong also said that \"The Monetary Authority of Singapore should look into the financial analyses and selling processes of the financial institutions and ask why they chose to sell the new issue to unsophisticated investors when the financial health of Hyflux had deteriorated in 2016 compared to 2014.\"\n\n&gt; Hyflux last week aborted a $530 million investment deal with would-be rescuer SM Investments (SMI) on the eve of a critical creditors\u2019 vote scheduled for April 5, throwing its own future into doubt.\n\n&gt; Around 34,000 retail investors sank a total of $900 million into Hyflux perpetual securities and preference shares. They stand to lose everything if the water treatment company fails in its debt restructuring attempt and ends up liquidated.\n\n&gt; Related Story Hyflux saga: Flood of questions over debt debacle\n\n&gt; Related Story Hyflux aborts rescue plan with time running out\n\n&gt; Related Story Back to square one for Hyflux as it seeks new white knight\n\n&gt; MAS in its response to the Bloomberg queries, said that as the issue manager, DBS conducted due diligence checks to ensure that material information relating to Hyflux was highlighted in the offering document.\n\n&gt; \"We note that Hyflux had disclosed in its offering document in 2016 that the Tuaspring power plant was expected to incur losses if electricity prices in Singapore were to remain low. The offering document was also cautious on the outlook for the water and energy markets,\" MAS said.\n\n&gt; Further, MAS noted that \"as a distributor of the securities, DBS complied with MAS' requirements to configure its ATM screens to remind investors to read the disclosure documents before making their applications\".\n\n&gt; The offering of securities through ATMs has been available since 1993. This has provided investors with a more convenient subscription channel for IPOs of shares or bonds.\n\n&gt; \"All investments carry risks. The deterioration in Hyflux's financial conditions that led to losses for investors illustrates this,\" MAS said.\n\n&gt; \"MAS, through the national financial programme MoneySENSE, has been working with industry and other stakeholders to educate investors about the features and risks of the various investment products and encourage investors to seek financial advice if needed. This also includes emphasising the importance of diversifying one's investment portfolio,\" it added.\n\n&gt; Separately, DBS was also the sole lead manager and bookrunner of Hyflux's issue of $400 million, 6 per cent preference shares on April 25, 2011, with retail investors allocated $200 million worth.

The suits allege that improper payments of $33.7 million were made by the town councils between 2011 and 2015 to FM Solutions and Services (FMSS) and FM Solutions and Integrated Services (FMSI). \u00a0\n\n&gt; The other defendants are former town councillors Chua Zhi Hon and Kenneth Foo, as well as FMSS founders How Weng Fan and her late husband Danny Loh.\n\n&gt; Over the course of the 17-day trial, the plaintiffs alleged that the payments made by the town councils were improper and void as these were paid out under the auspices of \u201cconflicted persons\u201d. Ms How was AHTC\u2019s deputy secretary and Loh, who died in an accident in 2015, was AHTC\u2019s secretary.\n\n&gt; In their written submissions, AHTC\u2019s lawyers said Mr Rajah\u2019s team had \u201cmischaracterised\u201d the town council\u2019s claim of S$33.7 million as a \u201cblanket claim\u201d. They said AHTC\u2019s claim was for \u201cequitable compensation\u201d in respect of any losses suffered due to the breaches uncovered.\n\n&gt; \u201c(The defendants) are liable for substitutive equitable compensation of S$33,717,535 unless they can show an offset,\u201d said the Shook Lin &amp; Bok team led by Mr David Chan.\n\n&gt; \u201cAHTC\u2019s primary case in respect of reparative equitable compensation is that Sylvia Lim, Low Thia Khiang, Danny Loh and How Weng Fan fall into a well-established category of fiduciaries and have committed culpable breaches of their duties.\u201d\n\n&gt; The defendants then have to show that losses \u201cwould still have occurred\u201d even without their breach of fiduciary duties, added the AHTC lawyers.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the lawyers continued to assert that AHTC became bankrupt and was in deep financial trouble at the end of 2014, while FMSS\u2019 profits increased by 300 per cent.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis is a case where the defendants have so recklessly managed, or abetted the reckless mismanagement of AHTC, such that AHTC\u2019s own auditors had to issue a disclaimer of opinion with 13 grounds of qualifications, leading to AGO (Auditor General\u2019s Office) and KPMG eventually uncovering a total of 185 control failures in AHTC\u2019s governance,\u201d said the lawyers.\n\n&gt; S$32M \u2018NOT FOUND TO BE IMPROPER PAYMENTS\u2019\n\n&gt; Mr Rajah told the court on Tuesday that some S$32 million was \u201cnot found to be improper payments by KPMG\u201d.\n\n&gt; In written submissions, his team noted that AHTC\u2019s accountants from KPMG had themselves concluded that the \u201cdetectable\u201d improper payments amounted to no more than S$1.52 million, of which only S$624,621 was recoverable. According to KPMG, claims for the remaining sums were \u201cnot determinable\u201d, the lawyers reiterated.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests that for these payments, KPMG could not ascertain whether AHTC had suffered any loss,\u201d they said, citing KPMG executive director Owen Hawkes who said on the stand that it was not possible to determine what part of the payments ought to be recovered.\n\n&gt; The bulk of the \u201crecoverable\u201d amount of S$608,911 was project management fees paid to FMSS, which KPMG claimed was wrong as they were for works that were not \u201cserious cyclical repairs and redecorations\u201d. \u00a0\n\n&gt; However, the Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah team said KPMG did not undertake any investigation on-site to evaluate if that was the case, and failed to take into account the past practice of Aljunied Town Council. When it was still controlled by People\u2019s Action Party MPs, the town council had classified similar services rendered as project management fees, they said.\n\n&gt; Excluding this sum, the \u201crecoverable\u201d amount only came up to S$15,710.\n\n&gt; The lawyers added that even the plaintiffs did not know whether there was any loss arising from \u201ccontrol failures\u201d in the rest of the S$33.7 million being claimed.\n\n&gt; As for payments to third parties that are also under claim, only S$1,965 out of more than S$5.4 million identified as improper was \u201cdeterminable\u201d, they noted, although the plaintiffs wanted reparations for S$2.79 million that was paid to LST Architects. The sum was seen as an unnecessary cost as AHTC had chosen the more expensive firm out of two choices of consultants.\n\n&gt; Mr Rajah\u2019s team also took issue with how the lawsuits relied \u201csolely\u201d on the reports by KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) \u2014 the two accounting firms hired by AHTC and PRPTC respectively to build their case in October last year \u2014 as they were not \u201cfactual witnesses\u201d.\n\n&gt; The lawyers also noted a discrepancy in the way AHTC and PRPTC had referred to their accountants in their closing arguments, stating that PRPTC called its accountant an \u201cexpert witness\u201d and not a \u201cfactual witness\u201d as AHTC had, suggesting the latter was \u201cless certain of its position\u201d.\n\n&gt; In wrapping up the case on Tuesday morning, Mr Rajah said the lawsuits uncovered \u201cnot a single instance of people taking money wrongly and putting into their pockets\u201d.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn a situation like that, you have breaches. They might not have complied with rules and regulations... (But) where is the loss, your Honour?\u201d he added.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe acted in what we believe is in the best interest of AHTC. We have to put FMSS on because we were going to be left without a willing managing agent. We wanted LST to be the architect because we believe they were the better and most appropriate architect.\u201d\n\n&gt; Pointing out that Section 52 of the Town Councils Act stated that no suit or legal proceedings shall lie personally against any member, officer or employee of a Town Council for anything done \u201cin good faith\u201d, Mr Rajah said: \u201cThat\u2019s what my clients had been doing in this case \u2014 trying to do their best out of a difficult situation.\u201d\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n0.5.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "author": "rsg-retrivr", "created_utc": 1554798513, "score": 0.9218}, {"body": "&gt; We have the power to protest anytime we want.

Here's my quick take: \n\n&gt; Citizens want something, citizens elect a government that promises to give them that thing. Government gives them that thing, or they get voted out next round. Isn't that how democracy is supposed to work?\n\nThis depends on your definition of a democracy, and I'll emphasise that definitions of \"democracy\" still vary. One of the other features of democracy is also the *protection of minorities*. So if citizens vote for a government that promises to kill all the LGBT folk - would this be considered a democracy? After all, they voted for it.\n\nAnother feature is the separation of powers. Say the elected government in tries to pass legislation to promote killing LGBT people on the street and the judiciary strikes it down. What would your ideal democracy do? In most democratic governments, we see that separation of powers stops elected governments from just passing legislation.\n\nThe electorate's desires may not be feasible because of other factors. For example - Brexit. Brexiters want to leave the EU. How do they want to leave the EU? (No one knows.) Will Britain leaving the EU give the Brexiters the outcomes they wanted? That depends on how the EU reacts - an external factor not within the Brexiters' control. \n\nSo the British government doesn't give the Brexiters what they want and the gov now gets voted out. Will changing the government still accomplish what the voters want (assuming that remains the same)? Unlikely - because it depends on the EU as well.\n\n&gt;  if one runs on the assumption that the people don't know what's good for them, only the intellectual and political elites know that best.\n\nNot really. There are other arguments against populism.\n\nI'm going to start with the simple definition of populism. It's generally agreed to have [two core principles:](http://theconversation.com/what-actually-is-populism-and-why-does-it-have-a-bad-reputation-109874)\n\n1. it must claim to speak on behalf of ordinary people\n\n2. these ordinary people must stand in opposition to an elite establishment which stops them from fulfilling their political preferences.\n\nSo your question is itself loaded - you've already pitched it as \"the people\" against \"the elites\". If I disagree with you, I'm automatically part of the elites. If I agree with you, I'm with the people. \n\nBecause of this, there is generally [no room for compromise](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/problem-populism-syriza-podemos-dark-side-europe), which is generally seen as [a feature of democracy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakedmorant/2019/01/28/compromise/). After all - everyone has different interests. Democracy (and indeed, maturity and adulthood) is about negotiating the difference between these interests.\n\nOn a practical level, populists also tend to promote policies that are questionably feasible - [this article calls it \"irresponsible bidding\"](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-43301423): \n\n&gt; \"In order to garner support, they're quicker than the establishment party to make offers, or to promise to change things\u2026 that on closer inspection may not turn out to be feasible.\"\n\n(See also: Brexit.)\n\nYou've also phrased it as \"the people don't know what's good for them\", which suggests that people vote for what's good for them. But that's not always why people vote. Voters don't always examine policies - they vote for [people who speak to an anger or insecurity they feel, or politicians who will hurt the other](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/8/18173678/trump-shutdown-voter-florida), or [with lower voices, or are taller, or any other superficial reason](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/opinion/campaign-stops/what-voters-want.html).\n\nBut I will also take your bait - let's be honest, individuals don't always \"know what's good for them\". For example, it's not disputed that vaccination is good - but anti-vaxxers are growing as a community. There are lots of reasons for why people make sub-optimal decisions, for example, they could be operating under [bounded rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality) by not having enough resources to make a full decision.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons why \"populist\" is seen as such a dirty thing, and it doesn't just come down to the way you've phrased it.", "author": "sitsthewind", "created_utc": 1555389928, "score": 0.6816}, {"body": "Wait weren't the two siblings (Hsien Yang and Wei Ling) fighting to have the house demolished?", "author": "Throwaway_29126", "created_utc": 1555402909, "score": -0.3612}, {"body": "Ehhh Goh Meng seng lol", "author": "Jammy_buttons2", "created_utc": 1555429554, "score": 0.4215}, {"body": "Does anyone happen to know what sort of graph is this: https://hackertarget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/portfreq.png", "author": "yunnnn", "created_utc": 1555430622, "score": 0.0}, {"body": "*Opposition parties that has been endorsed by the public will get my support buffs, while those who insist on contesting will get my debuffs.*\n\n\nSupport me and get haste, HS and bless.

But the concerns were either barely addressed by the Law Ministry since, or did not adequately address the concerns raised by these individuals and were quickly rebutted, it added.\n\n&gt; If left to proceed along these lines, POFMA will cause immediate and long-term harm to freedom of expression, impede the development of an engaged and thinking public, and erode trust in the government.\n\n&gt; The statement has been sent to all Members of Parliament, which the writers hope will encourage a more informed debate on the Bill in Parliament next month.\n\n&gt; They have recommended several directions for the MPs to consider when debating the Bill:\n\n&gt; Should it be decided in Parliament that POFMA proceeds, the statement urges the MPs:\n\n&gt; The statement elaborated on the three concerns raised by the writers on the POFMA.\n\n&gt; They contend that the Bill gives little clarity on how opinion pieces on government policies can completely avoid running afoul of POFMA, given that such articles would include a combination of diverse, and sometimes contradictory, facts and viewpoints during their analysis.\n\n&gt; Such ambiguity, they argue, will make it hazardous for journalists to practise their craft in an environment where\u00a0the Singapore government has demonstrated a low tolerance for even the slightest hint that it made a mistake.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis may result in news outfits likely choosing to pre-emptively self-censor or comply with directions without further thought, to avoid more severe legal ramifications such as curtailment of funding or imprisonment,\u201d the statement said, adding that the proposed Bill promotes a \u201ccarpet bombing\u201d mentality that pays no heed to nuances between facts, opinions and outright disinformation.\n\n&gt; The statement also contends that POFMA essentially makes the Government a reactive player in the fight against disinformation, rather than a proactive and engaged partner of serious media outlets. Such an approach leads to a public that will be increasingly distrustful towards both the Government and media outlets.\n\n&gt; It also argues that the Bill indicates a worrying trend of a government that is eager to implement laws that over-extend its reach into civic discourse and grants it unchecked powers that can be abused by this government or future ones.\n\n&gt; \u201cThis is patently unhealthy for public trust in the government, rendering any progress POFMA might make in securing free and fair elections nought,\u201d the statement said.\n\n&gt; Related stories:\n\n&gt; Virtually anything can be deemed \u2018misleading\u2019 under fake news law: historian Thum Ping Tjin\n\n&gt; COMMENT \u2013 Fake news bill: Time for lawyers, MPs to stand up and be counted\n\n&gt; Fake news bill: Media professionals favour fact-checking body, divided on its role\n\n&gt; Parliament: Draft bill proposes up to 10 years\u2019 jail for individuals who deliberately spread fake news\n\n---\n0.5.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "author": "rsg-retrivr", "created_utc": 1555562216, "score": -0.4941}, {"body": "The stupid article should have used more reputable names like Bertha Henson who was also against the fake news law instead of well known fake news spreader  Ravi Philemon, Kumaran Pillai etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKinda takes the credibility out of your article", "author": "CharAznia", "created_utc": 1555574159, "score": -0.6943}, {"body": "While U can question motives behind the reason for the lawsuit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't change the fact that there wouldn't be a lawsuit in the first place if \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1)WP did not screw up the management of AHTC   \n2)The lawsuit was not started by the Independent Panel that was appointed by WP", "author": "CharAznia", "created_utc": 1555577086, "score": 0.2252}, {"body": "I think now will be be more put off by the humongous number of opposition parties, instead of having a united front.", "author": "saggitas", "created_utc": 1555586271, "score": 0.7003}, {"body": "Well, the people have to make the choice between giving a weak opposition party a chance or to give a blank check for them to do as they wish without regard to their own welfare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut to some, that welfare simply means a packet of chicken rice every 5 years.

Divorce is frowned upon but still allowed, reluctantly, through Moses.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between sexual sin (fornication, adultery, homosexuality) and rules regarding how the people should live (shellfish, fabrics, tattoos, gossip etc). There\u2019s definitely a more eloquent theological explanation but it is more serious when the sin is committed against yourself than other kinds of sins like lying or theft\n\nTo love one another does not mean to be cool with anything and everything your brother is doing. Could you humour me for a bit? Imagine that you believe in a God that made mankind, and this God said not to do X. Seeing other people doing X and celebrating the doing of X would then concern you, would it not? Would you, in love, want that person to return to how God meant it to be? Alternatively, loving your child would mean that, for example, even if he is predisposed to obesity (is there such a thing haha maybe low metabolism), you\u2019d want him to exercise as much as possible to move away from that genetic predisposition because it is bad for him.\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading, thank you for your patience, I know some Christians, as people of every religion or non religion, can be snobby and insistent on imposing beliefs on others. This hasn\u2019t helped the recent tide of anti religious sentiment, fueled by opposition to what a religion says is an abomination.

Denial of Ethical and Moral Reasons against Allowing Abortion  \n Mr. Chua dismissed ethical, moral and social reasons against laws\n allowing abortion. He did not agree that allowing abortions reduced\n respect for the sanctity of life, or that it resulted in a degrading of\n character or problems of promiscuity or lack of responsibility.111\n Another parliamentarian later cited a steady increase in the number of\n unmarried women seeking abortions between the inception of the 1969\n Act and the Second Reading for the Abortion Bill of 1974. 112 Although\n such an increase did not in itself conclusively suggest that legalization of\n abortion caused promiscuity, the issue of whether allowing abortions\n showed disrespect for the sanctity of life depended on the answer to the\n metaphysical question about the worth of the unborn. Mr. Chua could\n not have been making a purely sociological dissociation between\n legalizing abortions and reduced respect. His argument would be most\n persuasive if abortions did not destroy life, and must thus be premised\n upon a rejection of the sanctity of the unborn' s life. Indeed, he\n dismissed the opposition of minority groups on religious and ethical\n grounds which he said were \"highly theoretical and emotional, of divine\n creation and the sanctity of the fertilized ovum or the foetus which is\n quite different from a living person.\" He regarded these arguments to be\n \"entirely futile and to ignore completely the realities of the modern\n world and its problems\" and invited the minority groups to visit the\n Woodbridge Hospital and view the mental defectives, suggesting that\n they would begin to \"question the very purpose of the Divine creating\n such mental defectives.\" The legislature's avoidance of the metaphysical question might\n have stemmed from a fear of intractable differences, given that different\n religions had different answers to offer on metaphysical questions.114\n **Mr. Chua suggested that persons who believed abortion to be wrong\n simply refrain from going for an abortion, but claimed that they should\n not impose their values on others.115 No one was forced to undergo or\n perform an abortion.116 Concerns of pro-lifers should be accommodated\n within the framework of each woman's choice,117 leaving each to settle\n the metaphysical question for herself.**\n Rawls has, similarly, opined that Catholics who fail to win a\n majority \"need not themselves exercise the right to abortion\" but \"can\n recognize the right as belonging to legitimate law enacted in accordance\n with legitimate political institutions and public reason, and therefore not\n resist it with force.\" Rawls views forceful resistance by Catholics to\n abortion as an \"attempting] to impose by force their own\n comprehensive doctrine that a majority of other citizens who follow\n public reason, not unreasonably, do not accept.\"118\n This position contrasts with Rawls's view in his earlier work,\n Political Liberalism, in which he said in a footnote that in the case of\n mature adult women, \"any comprehensive doctrine that leads to a\n balance of political values excluding that qualified right in the first\n trimester (to decide whether or not to end her pregnancy) is to that\n extent unreasonable; and depending on details of its formulation, it may\n also be cruel and oppressive; for example, if it denied the right altogether except in the case of rape and incest.\" In the earlier work,\n Rawls noted that to vote from a comprehensive doctrine that denied this\n right was to go against the ideal of public reason, even though the\n doctrine might be reasonable most of the time.119 He reasoned from the\n point of view of three political values when he concluded that the\n woman has the qualified right: the due respect for human life, the\n ordered reproduction of society over time, including the family in some\n form, and the equality of women as equal citizens. In his updated thesis\n on public reason,120 Rawls does not assess the comparative\n reasonableness of the arguments cast in the form of public reason for or\n against the right of abortion, though he acknowledges that arguments\n made for denying the right of abortion on the ground of political values\n of \"public peace, essential protections of human rights, and the\n commonly accepted standards of moral behavior in a community of law\"\n are such arguments.121\n Rawls' s position is slightly more elaborate on the justification of\n the right to abort than Mr. Chua's: Even in his earlier work where he\n cursorily dismissed the arguments of those who opposed a right to abort,\n Rawls recognized the need to argue for the woman's right to choose by\n reference to their autonomy, as balanced against other values. But\n Finnis, in reply, suggests that the idea that Catholics need not exercise\n the right does not address the issue of legitimate law. He likens abortion\n laws to the laws of South Carolina in 1859, 122 which compelled no white\n man to own slaves yet would be unacceptable today and seen as \"pro-\n slavery\" rather than \"pro-choice.\"123\n Further, Rawls surely does not mean to equate public reason with\n majority views, and if so, he must explain why the vote of citizens for\n the right of abortion is not unreasonable. Rawls has referred only to an\n article by Judith Jarvis Thomson. Finnis notes that this article does not\n adequately give a reasonable status to pro-abortion views as Thomson\n merely suggests that restrictive regulation of abortion severely\n constrains women's liberty, and such constraints may not be imposed in\n the name of considerations that the constrained are not unreasonable in rejecting. Finnis notes that she asserts that many women who reject the\n claim that the fetus has a right to life from the moment of conception are\n not unreasonable in doing so. This is a bald assertion and in fact\n unreasonable when no attempt is made to show how the unborn is\n different from the newborn, and why the newborn has rights which the\n unborn does not have.124\n Legal systems are not silent on abortion, for silence is seen as\n lending to controversy and doctors would be afraid of performing\n abortions only to be sued or prosecuted subsequently. Laws regulate\n abortion by allowing abortion in certain circumstances. Underlying the\n framework of choice is the view that values are subjective (or if\n objective, are not conclusively discoverable anyway), and religious\n persons should not impose their values derived from their religion on the\n rest of society which does not similarly value the life of the unborn. A\n common opinion is that this \"laissez faire\"125 approach to abortion does\n not resolve \"the difficult question of when life begins\"126 and impose on\n the religious. Mr. Chua said: \"The problem is not whether the foetus is\n inchoate and hence expendable as the law reformers claim, or whether it\n is human and inviolable as the opponents insist. The central problem is\n that of an unwanted pregnancy and how to treat it.\"127\n Yet, this settles the metaphysical question of the worth of the\n unborn. The pregnant woman is not regarded as imposing upon the\n unborn her metaphysical view about its worth by her choice to abort if\n and only if the unborn is not a person. As legal systems do not permit\n murder or the taking of an innocent life, allowing abortion is tantamount\n to concluding that abortion is not the taking of an innocent life, whether\n because the unborn is not a person or because its situation viz. the\n mother is such that the mother is entitled to have it removed.128\n In Singapore, the Select Committee pronounced that it \"did not\n think it fit to debate whether the foetus has a right to life or whether it\n should have human rights.\"129 Mr. Chua suggested it was just a \"view-\n point\" of the religious that abortion was murder, as \"(l)earned men,\n medical or otherwise, for centuries have not been able to agree on\n whether the foetus is human life.\" Yet, shortly after mentioning such an age-old debate, the Minister went on to pronounce that \"[a]n early\n conception is not a human being; it is a potential human being,\" citing\n the \"immense\" difference between an early embryo and a living person,\n as the embryo \"has no consciousness, no life experience.\"130 Surely\n these words attempted to settle the metaphysical question which he said\n was irresolvable. Indeed, at the Third Reading of the Bill, Mr. Chua\n said: \"[A]s far as I know, from the medical point of view, the foetus is\n not yet a human being, and as such, logically, how can it have human\n rights?\"\n Mr. Chua also referred to the treatment of the unborn fetus in law,\n and suggested that \"no abortionist in any community has been charged\n with murder for the destruction of the foetus.\"131 He suggested the same\n in parliamentary debates in 1980 when he said: \"In my training as a\n lawyer, I have never been taught that, in law, abortion is murder.\"132 By\n his reference to existing laws, Mr. Chua must have been aware that the\n law settled the metaphysical question of when life began. Further, if the\n very issue was the content of law, and whether it respected life,\n reference to the current state of the law in contention was unhelpful, if\n not spurious.\n The realization that the metaphysical question cannot be avoided\n raises the corollary question of how the metaphysical question may be\n resolved.

It's a means by which the government can demand that any organisation be reclassified as the government sees fit. TOC is a kind of journalistic platform; the powers-that-be now want to register the organisation as a political association. The site is to be designated as a political website. This means that TOC will fall under the rules that govern other (normal) political organisations\u2014like parties.  \n  \nUnder the Political Donations Act, TOC will be subject to a cap of 5,000 Singapore dollars ($3,900) in accepting anonymous donations and banned outright from receiving funds from foreign donors. The government's registry of political donations has already asked TOC to identify clearly all its owners, journalists and anyone else associated with the site. It was given two weeks to comply. And this is but one of the new rules to which the site will be subject. No specific reasons have been given for why the government wants to take this action, and at this particular moment in time. All the government has said, through its registry of political donations, is that \u201cAs a website that provides coverage and analysis of political issues, TOC has the potential to influence the opinions of their readership and shape political outcomes in Singapore.

The same, of course, could be said of almost any media organisation. More to the point, media observers say, is that there is a general election expected in the next few months and the Peoples' Action Party government wants to start exerting some control over the unruly, independent-minded blogosphere\u2014lest it spill over into effective opposition.

Some analysts argue that gazetting should not in fact make much practical difference to TOC's day-to-day operations. Indeed, the government argues that it will be free to carry on with its \u201cnormal, lawful operations\u201d. The aforementioned media expert, however, says that the action against TOC is intended to cause a chilling effect on its content and that of other websites as well. As a political association, TOC says it will have to comply carefully with the Broadcasting Act. It will have to mind more carefully what it says, and it may think twice before straying into controversial areas, such as homelessness and income inequality\u2014ie, the sort of self-censorship that the founder of Sintercom was not prepared to tolerate.  \n\nTOC, for its part, has sent off a letter to the prime minister's office asking for an explanation. The website argues that whereas it might have been critical of government policies, it has never indulged in \u201cpartisan\u201d politics. TOC also says that it is quite open and transparent enough already. It cheekily adds that the website merely tries to live up to the prime minister's words: he has said that he wants Singaporeans to be more \u201cunconventional\u201d and \u201cspontaneous\u201d.  \n\nUpdate: The Economist received a letter from Singapore's High commissioner in London about this post on January 21st.  \n\nDear Sir,\nYour 19 Jan article (\"A chill in the blogosphere\") wrongly portrays the Singapore Government's gazetting of The Online Citizen (TOC) as a political association to be an attempt to control and cow the online community.  \nThe principle that Singapore politics is for Singaporeans only applies to all political participants. They must not be sponsored, financially or otherwise, by foreign interests.  The Political Donations Act (PDA) was established to implement this principle.  Many countries have similar laws concerning foreign funding of political and lobby groups.  \nThe TOC provides coverage, commentary and analysis of political issues. But it is not just \"a kind of journalistic platform\".  It has organised polls on political issues and a forum for politicians, and mounted online and offline campaigns to change legislation and Government policies. Whether TOC is partisan or non-partisan is irrelevant; it is indubitably a participant in local politics. Hence it was gazetted under the PDA to prevent foreign involvement in Singapore politics through the TOC. This will impede neither TOC's activities nor its freedom of expression.  \nContrary to your article, the Government did not tell Sintercom to register as a political association. Sintercom was asked to register as an internet content provider, but refused. Being registered as a political association has not prevented other online entities, such as Singaporeans for Democracy, from continuing their operations unimpeded, because the requirements to be observed, as stated above, are reasonable. Indeed, TOC itself has expressed confidence that it could continue operating within the new parameters.  \nYours faithfully,  \nMichael Eng Cheng Teo,  \nHigh Commissioner for the Republic of Singapore  \nNote: We have turned off comments for this article.", "author": "onemanbrigade", "created_utc": 1558491496, "score": 0.9304}, {"body": "Good on Lee Hsien Yang.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this Wham is super itchy backside.

SMU, which had described the grades as \"bogus\", told The Straits Times on Friday (May 24) that this was the first time this had happened. \"The university has in place strict protocols with regard to grading and takes a serious view when protocols are not adhered to,\" the spokesman added.\n\nBut Prof Harney defended himself. The Canadian, who was informed in April before the incident that his contract would not be renewed, told ST he wanted to spare students the pressure to achieve high grades and did not want to \"artificially\" restrict the number of As through a bell curve. Given that he was due to leave the school on June 30, this gave him \"the opportunity to teach the course and grade it in the way I thought would be best pedagogically, without fearing the consequences from the school\".\nThe 57-year-old, who graduated from Harvard and has a doctorate from Cambridge, has been at SMU since 2012 and is the professor of strategic management at its Lee Kong Chian School of Business. He taught and graded a module called The Capstone: Studying Business Through the Classics, which involved two essays which made up 40 per cent, and a video project which made up the rest of the grade. Generally offered in the fourth year, the module helps students see connections between humanities, for instance works by Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, and business.\n\nBut when students across his four classes got their grades earlier this month, the grade for Prof Harney's module was missing. A few days later, SMU notified them it was recalculating their grades. A senior professor who \"taught the same version of capstone right from the very start\" was called in to help with the re-grading.\n\nSMU associate dean (undergraduate programmes) Michelle Lee explained in an e-mail to students: \"There is no variation to the scores he (Harney) assigned, even though the variation in work submitted is plain to see.\"\n\nEach student could choose whether to keep the adjusted grade or have \"pass\" reflected on the transcript. The latter option would not impact their grade point average. SMU would not reveal to The Straits Times how many students got a grade lower than the initial A.\n\nThe SMU spokesman said that while the university does not use a bell curve, there are guidelines for faculty members to refer to when grading. This is to ensure \"fairness and consistency\".\n\nProf Harney said the guidelines \"are really rules - that no matter how many students do well, the number of As is strictly limited to a third of the class\". And \"artificially restricting their grades on a bell curve\" was not his style of teaching, he added.\n\n\"These are fake ways to make your course seem serious. The real way is through deep engagement with the materials, ideas, and ourselves.\"\n\nSMU students ST spoke to said he was well-liked and was known to be \"chill\", or laid back. A 23-year-old student who declined to be named said: \"In the first class we attended, Prof Harney said he believes that all students should be able to get an A if they put in hard work, and he feels that it shouldn't be a competition.\"\n\nThe undergraduate was given a B+ after the adjustment, and chose to retain the grade.", "author": "djmatt85", "created_utc": 1558746028, "score": 0.7878}, {"body": "Pls tell me its not soon soon heng opp KSL", "author": "FlyingSpaghettiBalls", "created_utc": 1558750916, "score": 0.0772}, {"body": "Is this PPP-adjusted?", "author": "boldcounselor", "created_utc": 1558860603, "score": 0.0}, {"body": "Yeah this ain\u2019t gonna happen...\nI am not gonna take a stance on whether cannabis causes social harms or not.

Blame the foreigners.\n\nSo their entire idea is to limit foreign workers to only workers who can offer skills that Singaporeans cannot offer. First of all, the damage that will do to our economy is immense because it will increase costs for all our businesses, reduce manpower and make our businesses and economy uncompetitive competitive. We do not allow foreign workers in because we like them. We allow them in because they make us rich. If you kick them out, we will all be poorer. \n\nSecondly, the suggestion given is not pragmatic .

Moreover, we are focusing more on social problems.

However, pegging them is a different topic. The reason why you should not do that is because it is not a good indicator of Singapore's overall wellbeing as compared to GDP.\n\nLook at what Singapore really is. We are a tiny city state surrounded by gigantic unstable racist neighbors. Our dignified survival is highly dependent on our strength. What is the best measurement of our strength? GDP. GDP pays for military and soft power which in turn keeps us safe. Moreover, it also pays for social policies that solves social and environmental problems. GDP measures overall wellbeing of a country while low income earners or real income growth focus on just low income people or just wages of people which is just a small section of overall wellbeing of a country.\n\n5) SDP please stop with your ridiculous economic policies.

However, here are some problems I have with the testing framework:\n\n- Aren't you just basically saying that their degrees are worth squat? MIT grad coming to SG to work and have to be subjected to tests? I'd say screw it and aim higher (i.e. US or Canada).\n- Mugging is going to be a problem. SDP used to complain that Singapore national exams create people who are good at exams, but isn't their proposals also going to import people who are good at exams only? Would the \"skills tests\" be muggable? I mean, in my field (that is Computer Science), people already mug for Software Engineer interviews (by doing LeetCode, which is like \"10 year series\").\n\nOther problems I have with the overall hiring system is:\n\n- Burden of proof that \"no Singaporean can do the job\". How about jobs that Singaporeans do not want? Construction worker jobs can be done by any Singaporean. I mean, manual labour jobs can be done by degree holders. However, Singaporeans won't want the job because it's manual (or too back breaking, unglam, etc). Construction industry can't just close down, because there is always a demand for such services.\n- Retrench non-Singaporeans first. That sounds good on the surface, but how do you enforce this?

You can't just say \"Hey, you're lying!\" and prosecute every company for breaking this rule.\n\nI like that they came out with tangible policies (and not screaming out of their lungs like some opposition parties), but please, they seem to be naive and copying what other countries did to curb immigration.

SDP should have been more transparent and stated that these are not original ideas of theirs but actual policies and mechanisms that have been in placed a number of migrant and work destination countries of the 1st World such as OZ, NZ, Canada in the main , US and UK to some extent. Retrench a non-citizen recommendation however is the exception but these countries have another mechanism in play - visa quota when the economy is declining. . \n2. None of these require sitting special exams or tests on the part of the applicant. \n3. The points based approach for OZ requires the candidate to go thru the self assessment test to see if they meet the minimum points requirement. The points value changes based on demand and supply. These address the type of qualification you have, years of experience in that field, age, etc **These normally take about 10 minutes to complete.** This manages expectation and more importantly sets the quality benchmark for entrants that go over to OZ.\n4. Skills based testing again does not require candidates sitting a test. The qualification and experience in a particular field is submitted online to the respective trade and professional body for that sector for assessment. **If you are a software developer your qualification and experience is submitted to Australian Computer Society to assess your qualification.** It is not a govt body but the association of their members. They will look at academic qualification in that field, your experience and any skillset that you acquired along the way. What it does is that there is a minimum standard at every grade in a profession. Your CV if doctored, embellished etc is worthless as the assessment is done by experts in that field and not some civil servant in MOM. Here is the link for example.

These inherently have increased loss and increased latency over the above mentioned solution.  \n\n\n  \nKey point - Wireless is a near line of sight technology which can be both reflected and refracted (bent), meaning that you want to position your access point where it has line of sight to as many doorways as possible for maximum coverage off a single AP, however this might not be practical.  \n\n\nNot all APs are created equally - As mentioned, router wifi is usually crap, dedicated APs do a much better job, it can also be part of your config which affects it. Don't buy into buzz marketing tactics like \"Upto 1.5gbit/sec\" \"lightning fast speed\", the key stats you should be looking for is 3:3 MiMo or more, this means it has 3 antennas for transmit and 3 for receive. You may see a stat such as 3:3:3, where the final number after the 2nd colon represents how many spacial streams, to keep it simple, this is the offset of the transmitted wave amplitude from other signals. In a complex environment like an apartment, I highly recommend you ignore this, it is suited for large, open spaces with minimal obstructions.  \n\n\n2.4Ghz band - Use ONLY channels 1, 6 and 11, if you use any other channel, you are ruining both your wireless coverage, but also anyone elses in range.  \n5Ghz band - I recommend a 20 or 40hz wide channel, this will provide a good balance of speed and density, using 80 or 160 hz is just not required.  \n\n\nFinally, look at what channel you can use to extend your range, This image -  [https://www.ekahau.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/channel-overlap-2.png](https://www.ekahau.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/channel-overlap-2.png) \\- gives a representation of channel overlap and reinforces the above on the 2.4ghz band, you can use a free program called \"Wireless analyzer\" from the windows store to scan signals, set your AP to use which ever of 1, 6 or 11 has the least number, or at least the fewest strong signals on it when you roam around your home. If it has an adaptive setting you can use that too.  \n\n\nSorry if this is information overload, but you have a complicated issue without realising it.  \n\n\nAs general recommendations, for simple users, I recommend Google WiFi, for a more complicated or enthusiast setup, I recommend Ubiquitis range. Note both setups support PoE (Power over Ethernet), which gives you the flexibility to place the AP where ever you need with only a single ethernet cable leading to it, however you will still need a power injector at the root end before it connects to the rest of your network, or a PoE switch.  \n\n\nHope this helps.", "author": "Stegles", "created_utc": 1561513352, "score": 0.9961}, {"body": "Even though it is an unpopular policy, it is very important Singapore attracts the very best foreign talent here in order to boost our competitiveness.\n\nCountries like India, Japan, China can search for talent within their huge population but Singapore cannot do that.

A large reason why people procrastinate and find easier things to do is because...the main task seems really daunting to begin with. \n\n\"Clean your room\" sounds really hard. Like where do you even start? There's just so many things. However if you tried to break up a big daunting task into a series of steps, they all become small and managable.\n\n\"Clean your desk\" -&gt; \n1) Remove all items that shouldn't be on your desk in the first place and put it into a plastic bag\n2) Wipe your desk clean of dust and dirt\n3) Group related items on your desk together. Eg. all stationary together.\n4) Find a container for groups of items and put it back on your desk. (eg. cup for stationary)\n5) Group related items from the box in step 1) together, and place them into separate containers\n6) Put those containers aside for another day.\n\n&gt; By the time I've complete those other sub task, my desk is probably dirty again.

You are able to do some sub-tasks, but you have a problem keeping things neat and tidy. Basically your cleanup rate = your mess up rate.

Mess up a clean room. Clean up a mess. Yeah you get the point.\n\nI found a solution that seems to be working for me so far. Basically I ensure that almost every object I own (with a few exceptions) has a \"container\" that it belongs to. This achieves 3 things. 1) When an object is out of it's container, it's immediately obvious that it doesn't belong there and I should put it back. 2) There's no mental overload of wondering where to put it since everything has a place. 3) Containers also help to contain a mess. Eg. I have a pencil holder and it's starting to get super cluttered. However it cannot overflow to bigger than the size of the container, and this prevents the clutter from spreading to the rest of my desk.\n\nI can share more about this 'containerization' if you're interested.\n\n&gt;Once I realised what I'm doing, I start noticing this behaviour everywhere.

I think that one source of grievance among the pro-China camp is that they want us to have a relationship that is equally close to China vs the US. You are right that there are many careful and intelligent people in our government who have considered this and have decided that, at least for now, this is impossible.  The reasons for this have little to do with any sort of cultural animus towards China or any direct attraction towards emulating the US democracy or opposition towards the Chinese system.   \n\n\nThe first part of the problem is Asean. The US is has no territorial disputes with any Asean member. The US is far enough away that it is unlikely to become a direct party to a long standing dispute with an Asean member. As an added perk, The US has no problems with being friends with Taiwan.   \n\n\nThe Second part of the problem is racial. A closer relationship with the US carries pretty minimal racial implications. I think the Chinese government is discrete and intelligent enough to try to build a relationship that is along similar lines to the best of their ability, but the problem is that there is a language barrier and cultural distance for our Malays and Indians who are less likely to benefit from perks that get showered in us. It is not beyond the imagination that if we prioritized China over the US, there will be less restrained Chinese Singaporeans who will want racial preferences in all our corporate and public key appointment holders 'for economic ball carrying reasons'. If we consider low probability/catastrophic events, US government is very unlikely to go to war with India or seize islands in Malaysia and Indonesia, thus complicating things for us. I am worried about the longer term effects of Xinjiang. If you think about all the radicalism that US atrocities in war on terror created, we are still in the early days for China.  \n\n\nEven if we assume that China was the equal of the US in all respects ( and they are not.

I can only assume U have short term memory or U are too young(seeing as how naive U are, probably the latter) to remember. Singapore went through the same phase back in 2011. Its safe to say it takes A LOT for Singaporeans to come out in protest of the govt and protest they did when the population whitepaper came out(just in case U were wondering if Singapore would actually do a HK protest, yes we will if it gets that bad). 2011 mark a time where property was expensive, wait for HDB was long(more than 5 years vs the 2.5 years today) and public transport was breaking down. They focus all their problems on Foreigners whom they see main cause of all those issues.   \n\n\nWhile there will always be some grumblings about foreigners in SG, things have since died down. Even the opposition were not making it an election issue in during GE2015, yet between 2011 - 2015, the non resident population actually grew by about 300K. Why did we stop complaining? Because the problems were fixed. HDB wait is now 2.5years. Property prices have stablized. MRT hardly breaks down anymore.   \n\n\nForeigners were never the cause of the issues that Singapore face, it was a combination of the BTO scheme(due to the property crash in 97), the govt's failure to foresee the increase in manpower needs(ironically was due to their own economic success) in 2000-2010 period as well as poor oversight of MRT management.

Rather, it is up to each country to decide domestically what emissions reduction target it will include in its NDC and what domestic policies and measures it will design and implement to achieve its chosen target. This is as true for the United States as it is for China, India and other countries.\n&gt;\n&gt; President Trump did not acknowledge in his announcement that the US is also a \"leading emitter\". Of all the GHG emissions ever produced, the US has contributed the largest share, making the US is the single, largest cumulative emitter of GHGs. The US is currently second only to China in annual emissions.  \n&gt;\n&gt; In per capita terms, however, the average person in the US emits far more than someone in China or India: in recent years, emissions per capita in the US were 10 times as large as those in India, and well over double the per capita emissions in China. The difference in GDP per capita is similarly huge, with the US at ~10 and ~4 times the GDP per capita of India and China respectively in 2015.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most of the obligations under the Paris Agreement apply to all Parties, including the world\u2019s leading polluters such as China and India. This was one of the great achievements of Paris \u2013 that it delivered an agreement where all countries accepted they must contribute to global efforts to reduce emissions. The Agreement does not include any obligations that apply only to the United States.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, all Parties to the Paris Agreement (148 Parties at present) have agreed to pursue a 1.5 degree limit to global warming, and recognised the need to peak global emissions as soon as possible and to reduce them rapidly to zero emissions in the second half of this century. Each Party to the Agreement has also agreed to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that they intend to achieve, to pursue domestic mitigation measures with the aim of achieving the objectives of their NDCs, and to bring forward successive NDCs every five years, representing a progression beyond their current NDC and reflecting their highest possible ambition.\n\nMoreover, not just are the US neglecting to tackle climate change, they are exacerbating it by encouraging fossil fuels. In your opinion, is their neglect for the well-being of future generations moral?\n\n&gt; Paris climate accord. No.\n\nMost countries, including all major economies, are party to the accord. Considering that the US is the second worst polluter, their pulling out is a massive setback for the world order. You seem to disagree, why? \n\n&gt; Illegal wars. Maybe.\n\n[Legality of the Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_the_Iraq_War):\n\n&gt; The then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated in September 2004 that: \"I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter. From our point of view and the UN Charter point of view, it [the war] was illegal\", explicitly declaring that the US-led war on Iraq was illegal.\n\nWhy maybe? Do you have a different interpretation of the UN charter?\n\n&gt; \"Unilateral economic actions that violate WTO rules\". No.\n\n[WTO set to probe Trump's tariffs on China](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/wto-set-to-probe-trumps-tariffs-on-china):\n\n&gt; \"This WTO case is especially significant because it deals with the central international legal issue in the US conduct of its trade war with China - whether the US can impose trade restrictions on China in response to alleged Chinese WTO violations without first seeking dispute settlement in the WTO,\" Mr James Bacchus, a former Democratic congressman and onetime head of the WTO's appellate body, said in an e-mail.\n&gt; \"I believe these US tariffs are inconsistent with WTO obligations, but it will be left to my successors on the WTO appellate body to decide.\"\n\nYou seem to think otherwise, why? Can you substantiate your assertion that Trump isn't breaking WTO rules?\n\n&gt; Yes, it does. By literally any measure, the US upholds human rights far better than China. Dissidents in the US are able to broadcast their opposition on national TV, literally cut off the head of an effigy of the president. Can the same be said for dissidents in China? Suspected criminals in the US have recourse to fair trials and impartial courts, even suspected terrorists have the media advocating for their rights in the case of gitmo. Can the same be said for China?\n\nSure, for their own citizens. But the US have not upheld basic human rights of hundreds of thousands of civilians around the world. Both from horrific wars and their support for authoritarian regimes. That is why in my opinion, they aren't any better than the Chinese.\n\n&gt; You don't need to be an \"american lapdog\" to support respect for basic human rights, government accountability, due process and condemn authoritarian regimes. If not out of a sense of right and wrong, then for our own self interest. Authoritarian regimes that do not respect the rights of their own people, are not accountable to the public and do not believe in due process are the ones we should fear the most.\n\nI think we are in agreement then. The US regularly installs and supports authoritarian regimes with complete disregard for human rights, the US themselves regularly directly infringe on the basic human rights of citizens from other countries. China at present are too authoritarian for my personal taste. Neither is a beacon of morality - so we must do the sensible thing, stay unaligned for now, and only pick sides when we know who will best serve our interests.", "author": "jtcd", "created_utc": 1564396923, "score": 0.9724}, {"body": "&gt;In general, do you think the US's \"regime change\" approach that has included installing dictators they later started wars against, and caused so much suffering in that region has been moral? \n\nSmart? No. Moral? Yes. Something cannot be moral only with the benefit of hindsight. No one went into the middle east with the intention of slaughtering civilians or destroying lives. The fact that the situation spiraled out of control does not discount the moral imperative that led to intervention.\n\n&gt;Sure, if hundreds of thousands are being slaughtered, for example in the Rwandan genocide, there could be moral justification for intervening \n\n If we believe that there is a case for military intervention, then we must neccessarily accept thr possibility of collateral damage. Is intervention only moral when it's successful and immoral when it fails? **It's logically inconsistent to approve of intervention on humanitarian grounds, and then decry it as immoral when there are casualties in the process of intervention**. \n\n&gt;In your opinion, morally, how do the US's actions in the middle east stack up against China's re-education camps for separatists? \n\nThe intent is important. I cannot fault the US intervention in the middle east any more than I can fault the Great Leap Forward in China. Both were borne out of moral intentions but failed disastrously. What I can fault is the ruthless suppression of dissent and criticism. \n\n&gt;The Paris accord did not obligate any country to do anything. The US's opposition was based on nonsensical logic. They were upset that China's emissions were higher and could increase more, unfortunately, they didn't take into account the fact that China's per-capita emissions were far lower than the US's.\n\nIf there were no obligations, then them pulling out should have no impact. Countries have the right to enter into and pull out of as they please. North Korea pulling out of the non-proliferarion treaty is not inherently immoral, threatening it's neighbours with nuclear destruction is. \n\n&gt;Moreover, not just are the US neglecting to tackle climate change, they are exacerbating it by encouraging fossil fuels. In your opinion, is their neglect for the well-being of future generations moral?\n\nIf it is immoral when the US exacerbates climate change, then is it equally immoral when you or I drive a car, or use plastic bags or eat meat? By that logic every single person who isn't living a carbon neutral lifestyle is immoral for \"neglecting the well being of future generations\", which is ridiculous. \n\n&gt;Considering that the US is the second worst polluter, their pulling out is a massive setback for the world order. You seem to disagree, why? \n\nPart of the world order is that countries have the right to leave and enter agreements as they please. Leaving a treaty is not inherently immoral. \n\n&gt;Why maybe? Do you have a different interpretation of the UN charter?\n\nMaybe because though the war was pretty shady, it could be argued that Iraq was already in breach of UN resolutions and thus action had to be taken to enforce them. But I agree it would have been better if it had passed through the proper channels. \n\n&gt;US and UK officials have argued that existing\u00a0UN Security Council\u00a0resolutions related to the\u00a01991 Gulf War\u00a0and the subsequent\u00a0ceasefire(660,\u00a0678), and to later inspections of Iraqi weapons programs (1441), had already authorized the invasion\n\n&gt;You seem to think otherwise, why? Can you substantiate your assertion that Trump isn't breaking WTO rules?\n\nTariffs based on national security concerns are exempt from WTO rules. Similarly it could be argued that the WTO has repeatedly failed to take China to task regarding it's flouting of trade violations and this was a last resort. \n\n&gt;Sure, for their own citizens. But the US have not upheld basic human rights of hundreds of thousands of civilians around the world. Both from horrific wars and their support for authoritarian regimes. That is why in my opinion, they aren't any better than the Chinese\n\nLet's say you're right and the US only upholds the human rights of their own citizens.

The morality of cold war USA is about as relevant to the morality of modern day USA as the morality of cold war USSR is to the morality of modern day Russia.\n\nYou answer is nonsensical. My question was not about the cold war, or the US's activities in the past. The US **support authoritarian regimes right now** and continue to pursue regime change:\n\n1. [Here\u2019s John Bolton Promising Regime Change in Iran by the End of 2018](https://theintercept.com/2018/03/23/heres-john-bolton-promising-regime-change-iran-end-2018/).\n\n2. The US **continues** to support authoritarian regimes - [Trump vetoes Congress\u2019s attempt to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-vetoes-congresss-attempt-to-block-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/2019/07/24/7b047c32-ae65-11e9-a0c9-6d2d7818f3da_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.463a9131e206). Notably, you seem to have something against \"making critics disappear\". The US supports the Saudis despite the Saudis murdering a dissenting journalist in cold blood.\n\n**How do you reconcile considering authoritarian regimes to be immoral with considering the US to be moral despite their installing and supporting authoritarian leaders?**\n\n## US Baiting Iran Despite Knowing Death Tolls Will Be Horrific\n\nIn this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/citegy/singapore_and_china_to_conduct_10day_bilateral/evbz9mz/), you made this statement in defense of the suffering that the US have inflicted on civilians:\n\n&gt; No one went into the middle east with the intention of slaughtering civilians or destroying lives.\n\nIn response, I pointed out that the US are angling for war with Iran **despite knowing that civilians will be slaughtered**. This is a clear indication that the US aren't all that bothered about killing civilians. Again, your response was nonsensical as it clearly contradicts the above-mentioned statement:\n\n&gt; What is the world supposed to do? Stand idly by while Iran sponsors terrorism, threatens it's neighbors with nuclear destruction and oppresses its people? Is it immoral to impose sanctions on a rogue state like North Korea because it's \"baiting them into war\" or is the true immorality on the part of the North Korean regime.\n\nYou've pivoted from claiming that the US are innocent and won't kill intentionally to justifying mass killing of civilians just because you don't like Iran's government. Earlier, you raised this hypothetical situation for when you feel military intervention is warranted \"if a government is committing genocide against its people, is it morally right to intervene militarily?\" Iran are not committing genocide. Your grudge against them isn't universally held. Iran was trying to reform their country, they had a nuclear deal with the US and other major powers, were abiding by it and opening up their economy - [IAEA Report Says Iran Continues To Comply With Nuclear Deal](https://www.rferl.org/a/iaea-report-says-iran-continues-to-comply-with-nuclear-deal/29974795.html). The US left the deal just because of their own internal politicking - [New U.K. Memo Leak Claims President Trump Pulled Out of Iran Nuclear Deal to Spite Obama](https://time.com/5626104/leaked-british-memo-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-obama/).\n\nSo, the question is, **in your opinion, is killing hundreds of thousands of civilians because you don't like their rulers morally acceptable?**\n\n&gt; Once again, you're assuming the US does not have the ability to estimate death tolls. See 2. - despite knowing just how destructive their invasions can be, they have no qualms about starting more invasions.\n\nDon't be silly. No one goes into a war thinking they are going to lose. If they could have predicted the quagmire in Iraq they wouldn't have pursued it.\n\n## Decline of the US World Order\n\nI made the point: \n\n&gt; When the country that used to have the leadership role abandons the rest of the world for its own selfish goals, it undermines that country's world order. \n\n## Decline of the Rules Based World Order\n\nYou spouted some fabricated definitions:\n\n&gt; The \"rule\" in \"rules based international order\" is not that you have to sacrifice your economic potential to save the world. The \"rule\" is that you can't willfully send your own people to concentration camps, violently crush protests or make critics disappear.\n\nRubbish. The rules based world order is a commonly used phrase with an accepted definition. [THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE RULES-BASED INTERNATIONAL ORDER](https://www.unaa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/UNAA_RulesBasedOrder_ARTweb3.pdf), what is the rules-based world order?:\n\n&gt; This means a shared commitment by all\ncountries to conduct their activities in accordance with agreed rules that evolve over\ntime, such as **international law**, regional **security arrangements**, **trade agreements**,\nimmigration protocols, and cultural arrangements. \n\nNow, why was the rules based world order even brought up? \n\n[You said](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/citegy/singapore_and_china_to_conduct_10day_bilateral/evbj1w3/):\n\n&gt; part of that responsibility to our citizens is to uphold a rules based international order.\n\n[I agreed, and said](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/citegy/singapore_and_china_to_conduct_10day_bilateral/evbpfki/):\n\n&gt; I'm glad you are aware of this, it is a major reason why I am against us being a US lapdog. The US have been chipping away at the rules based international order. From the Paris climate accord, to illegal wars and unilateral economic actions that violate WTO rules.\n\nWith a complete lack of intellectual integrity, you then suddenly decided to redefine \"rules\". The fact is, that through short-sighted pursuit of selfish interests, the US is hurting institutions like the UN and the WTO. These institutions are losing the respect of other nations ([WTO: Struggling to stay relevant](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/wto-struggling-to-stay-relevant/article28627776.ece))\nif the US bends rules so blatantly, why should anyone else abide by them?\n\n**Do you agree that the US's policies of late have hurt the rules based world order?**\n\n## Climate Change and the Need for Action at the Governmental Level\n\nI said this:\n\n&gt; You need to read up on climate change. **The biggest (by far) contributors to green house gases are energy generation from fossil fuels and industrial processes. To mitigate such emissions, the solution is to invest in renewable energy sources and cleaner industrial processes. The onus is on governments to support such investments.** The problem with the US is that they're going backwards and supporting dirty energy sources like coal despite knowing full well that future generations will suffer for it.\n\nAs usual, I substantiated these facts with links to objective evidence.\n\nYour response: \n\n&gt;&gt; The onus is on governments to support such investments.\n&gt; You keep repeating this but you don't say why. Government is nothing but a collection of individuals acting collectively. If you and I can't be bothered to drastically change our lifestyles to save the earth, why should the governments we elect be any different?\n\nI have said why. To repeat: \n\n&gt; **The biggest (by far) contributors to green house gases are energy generation from fossil fuels and industrial processes. To mitigate such emissions, the solution is to invest in renewable energy sources and cleaner industrial processes. The onus is on governments to support such investments.**\n\nThe best thing individuals can do is to elect governments that will invest in such changes. \n\nAlso, \"If you and I can't be bothered to drastically change our lifestyles to save the earth\" this is bullshit. What makes you think others don't care? [Do Singaporeans really care about climate change?](https://www.eco-business.com/news/do-singaporeans-really-care-about-climate-change/):\n\n&gt; There is a strong sense of responsibility from Singaporean citizens to act.

Kudos to you for making it but the fact remains that our current system is unequal and is only getting more and more unequal as we 'grow' as a nation. \n\n&gt;Because in their attempt to level with the opposition support amongst the poorest 20%, the present government has compromised the rewards of individuals who worked hard to punch above the economic class that they were born into. The gains of such individuals are suddenly burdened by higher taxes to distribute to those who expect to be able to own a house, settle down and start a family despite making choices that they cannot afford.\n\nWrong. One of the key reason why you were able to 'make it' is because you are born in Singapore. As someone who grew up in a low-income family, I know for a fact that if it isn't for the govt's assistance, I wouldn't be able to attend school if I had been born in other countries. Growing up, I benefited from govt's financial assistance and I fully intend to give back to the system. I don't think of it as 'unfair'. In fact, it is only right that I give back to a system that gave me so much. \n\nBut as someone who had also worked in a charity with low-income, disadvantage households, I think the government can still do more to help the poorest of our society. Rising inequality doesn't make for more prosperity. If you look at other countries with growing unrest, the roots of their discord arise from extreme inequality. It is in everyone's interest to ensure that the basic welfare of everyone is taken care of. We can't call ourselves a developed country if we can't even take care of those who had been systematically disadvantaged by the system. \n\nIt REALLY REALLY grinds my gear when people call the poor 'undeserving' or 'entitled'.

This is actually the most commonly seen of our softshell turtles, although it is not native. Hailing from temperate East Asia, the Chinese Softshell Turtle reaches up to 25 centimetres in carapace length. Large numbers are raised on farms in China for human consumption, and today, the market for turtle meat in Singapore mostly relies on imported Chinese Softshell Turtles. These are usually imported live, and slaughtered just before consumption. In the 1970s, there were also attempts to raise Chinese Softshell Turtles in local farms. While this species can be legally imported and traded for food, it is not allowed to be sold as a pet, but hatchlings are sometimes still seen for sale in aquarium shops.\n\nSightings of Chinese Softshell Turtles [in various locations](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2014-264.pdf) around Singapore, mostly in our reservoirs, and ponds in urban parks and gardens, represent individuals that have escaped or were released by people, although it is not known if this species has managed to breed in Singapore.\n\nThe Chinese Softshell Turtle has traditionally been considered to have a very wide range across East Asia, from the Russian Far East and Korean Peninsula to Japan, China, and Vietnam. However, *Pelodiscus sinensis* has since been recognised to [be a species complex](http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Articles/Fritz_etal_2010b.pdf), and [more species have been identified](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1439-0469.2011.00632.x) in recent years. Instead of a single wide-ranging species, there are now at least [five distinct species](https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/31376/), and all are threatened in the wild. Although large numbers of these turtles are raised on farms in China, this is actually a problem, as different softshell species are being kept together, [leading to hybridisation](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s00114-018-1558-9).  If hybrids or species not native to a particular area end up in the wild, this could further threaten native populations. Whether the Chinese Softshell Turtles in Singapore are exclusively 'true' *Pelodiscus sinensis* or include some of the other species, such as *Pelodiscus maackii* or *Pelodiscus parviformis*, is unknown.\n\n**[Asian Softshell Turtle](https://flic.kr/p/6eFqv6) (*Amyda ornata*)**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Asian Softshell Turtle has been split into two species, with the populations in Sumatra, Borneo, and Java retaining the name *Amyda cartilaginea*, while the populations from the northeast Indian subcontinent, Myanmar, Thailand and Indochina are now known as *Amyda ornata*. This has not been universally adopted, and common names have yet to be coined to reflect this split. For now, the native Asian Softshell Turtle populations of Singapore are assumed to be *Amyda cartilaginea*. However, there have been [sightings of individuals](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2015-122.pdf) that appear to be more similar to those from Thailand and Indochina, and so these are thought to be records of *Amyda ornata*, brought into Singapore and released by people.\n\n**[Wattle-necked Softshell Turtle](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/species/wattle-necked-softshell-turtle/) (*Palea steindachneri*)**\n\nThis species is native to southern China and Vietnam, and is also heavily exploited for food. It has a carapace length of more than 40 centimetres. In June 2012, a large softshell turtle was [found on Tyersall Avenue](http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/news2/2012/16072012-rareturtle.pdf), near the Botanic Gardens. It might have been run over by a vehicle, as it had a cracked carapace. ACRES rescued the turtle, and identified it as a Wattle-necked Softshell Turtle, but it died from its injuries. This individual was likely illegally imported and then escaped or released.\n\n**[Indian Flapshell Turtle](https://flic.kr/p/QjpiSf) (*Lissemys punctata*)**\n\nThis species is native to the Indian subcontinent, and has a carapace of up to 37 centimetres. Members of this genus are easily recognised by having [moveable flaps](http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Accounts/crm_5_076_punctata_v1_2014.pdf) on the plastron (the underside of the shell), which can close to protect the hind legs. The front part of the plastron is also flexible, and covers the head and front legs when they are retracted.\n\nIn May 1990, a skeleton of a softshell turtle was found along the bank at Upper Seletar Reservoir, and recognised as [belonging to an Indian Flapshell Turtle](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/38rbz027-030.pdf). However, the skeleton was subsequently reidentified as that of an Asian Softshell Turtle. But in August 2001, a live Indian Flapshell Turtle was caught in a pond in Kranji, confirming that at least one individual of this species had been released in Singapore.\u00a0", "author": "kodomodragon", "created_utc": 1566989325, "score": -0.743}, {"body": "**[Fly River Turtle](http://www.edgeofexistence.org/species/pig-nosed-turtle/) (*Carettochelys insculpta*)**\n\nThis entirely aquatic species is not a softshell turtle, but is the sole surviving representative of a related family.

However, its shell is not flexible, and its limbs are modified into flippers, like those of a sea turtle.\n\nThe Fly River Turtle is native to rivers of New Guinea and parts of Australia\u2019s Northern Territory, but is heavily exploited, both for food and [the international pet trade](https://www.traffic.org/site/assets/files/8647/pig-nosed-turtle.pdf). Large numbers of eggs are collected from the wild and incubated, then the hatchlings are exported or [smuggled](https://www.traffic.org/publications/reports/assessing-the-trade-in-pig-nosed-turtles-in-papua-indonesia/), often passed off as \u2018captive-bred\u2019, and shipped to other countries.

In 2005, in an attempt to manage the trade in this species, it was listed on [Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)](https://www.cites.org/eng/app/index.php), meaning that all international trade in the Fly River Turtle was regulated and subject to permits. In Singapore, all trade in this species was banned, although it still kept [popping up in the shops for some time](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C9FF6CB000BAFB52A91B0C0B4B24BF9B/S003060530700155Xa.pdf/are-tortoises-and-freshwater-turtles-still-traded-illegally-as-pets-in-singapore.pdf), until AVA finally started enforcing the ban. There are some people in Singapore who own Fly River Turtles as pets, but they are allowed to keep them as long as these turtles have a carapace length of more than 20 centimetres, since these represent turtles that would have been imported before 2005.\n\nFly River Turtles have also been [appearing in the wild](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2015-162.pdf) in some of our reservoirs, lakes, and ponds, and are almost certainly abandoned pets.

If renewables are competitive with conventional energy sources the market will supply it, no need for distortive market intervention. If it\u2019s cheaper, consumers will buy it instead of more expensive conventional sources.\n\nThere\u2019d be no need to propagandize in favor of it, the price signals will do that for you.\n\nBut as it turns out, real-life transition to renewables is still [a lot more complicated and expensive](https://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/pubs/2019/7299-system-costs.pdf) than anti-free-market ideologues like to pretend:\n\n&gt;Under the cost assumptions of the present study, the generation mix which meets the electricity demand at a minimal cost relies mainly on dispatchable low-carbon generation technologies, such as nuclear power and hydroelectric power. An appropriate combination of these two technologies as well as of gas-fuelled power plants means meeting carbon emission targets with maximal economic efficiency. The cost of electricity generation increases with the share of VRE [variable renewable energies] enforced in the system. While the additional costs are limited at low VRE targets, **they increase markedly at higher penetration levels**; this reflects not only higher plant-level generation costs for VRE resources, but also additional challenges stemming from the deployment of additional VRE units into the generation mix and their decreasing value for the system. Modelling results indicate that electricity generation costs increase by 17% with respect to the base case scenario when a 30% VRE penetration is reached. Imposing higher VRE targets of 50% and 75% of the total electricity generation increases generation costs by 33% and by more than 70%, respectively. For a mid-sized country such as the one represented in this study, **additional costs for electricity generation are in the range from a few to several tens of billion USD per year**.\n\n&gt;. . . System costs calculated on the basis of an increase of the unit costs of VRE can be substantial and depend again on the level of penetration. At 10% of electricity generation the system cost of VRE are still limited at 7 USD/MWhVRE. At 30% VRE penetration, total system costs more than double, up to 17.5 USD/MWhVRE, and they reach 30 USD/MWhVRE at 50% penetration. Higher deployment targets of VRE lead to system costs of 50 USD/MWhVRE.\n\n&gt;. . . These considerations raise serious questions concerning the optimal deployment level of VRE technologies and the long-term economic sustainability of the support mechanisms that are currently employed for their deployment.\n\nOECD Report, The Costs of Decarbonization at 213.\n\nBeing practical means looking at the real-world experiences of others and the actual consequences of renewables policy elsewhere. Germany was very ambitious on renewables and committed to an aggressive transition a few years ago, by subsidizing them \u2014 a form of market distortion. What happened after that?\n\n&gt;Germany constitutes a telling example of this situation. Between 2006 and 2017, over 70 GW of new wind and solar PV plants have been deployed and the penetration level of VRE has increased from 6% to over 22% of the total generation (in terms of TWh). **In the same time period, retail prices have increased much more than in other European countries and in the last five years Germany has had the highest electricity prices for households and small businesses**, despite having one of the lowest wholesale prices in Europe.\n\nI\u2019ll believe it\u2019s cheaper when firms queue up to displace conventional supplies. If it\u2019s truly cheaper, suppliers of renewables will enter the market to eat non-renewables\u2019 lunch, and price competition will eventually oust more expensive fossil fuel sources from the market.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s not \u2014 if subsidies and intervention are necessary to make renewables competitive \u2014 then they aren\u2019t actually cheaper, are they?\n\nBanal generalities like \u2018there are market failures in U.S. healthcare and our intervention in the housing market shows intervention isn\u2019t necessarily bad\u2019 doesn\u2019t answer the question of whether intervention in a different market is good or bad.

What began as a serious communications breakdown (between the academic arm of the College, and its administrative staff, and Mr. Alfian) has turned into a public discussion about who is to blame. Such discussions are rarely productive. This is why, despite early engagement, I've backed off from public comment on the affair. It seems to me that public discussion of that kind will only deepen the wounds felt by Mr. Alfian or other affected folks.\n\nMy own view is that it is structure and process that are to blame, and senior College administrators who are responsible for fixing that. (For the philosophers of moral responsibility following along at home, this tracks the distinction between \"attributability\" and \"accountability\").\n\nAmong those who are neither to blame nor to be held accountable for fixing things up are: (a) junior staff members, or (b) Mr. Alfian himself. I suspect staff were caught between the goal of getting a charismatic and prominent local figure to offer a valuable module (this is a well-known playwright with 25,000 FB followers, remember, who has the ear of every opposition media and artistic personality on the island -- not exactly peer-to-peer communication here!), a deadline, and a new and not entirely clear process for approving and launching these experiential modules. I think Mr. Alfian himself, who had plainly good intentions, was similarly put into a tight spot by poor communications and a deadline.\n\nIt may appear that there is a serious conflict between the College's \"official story\" and what Mr. Alfian has shared, and that this shows that someone is lying. This is not the case. The conversations Mr. Alfian references are real (Mr. Alfian has shared screenshots, and I've seen others as well). And the College's story is true (I\u2019ve confirmed this in some detail myself, in various ways; *trust but verify* is my maxim here). No one, *literally not a single person involved*, as far as I can tell, is lying or malicious or anything like that.

But as much as many would like to see it as a legal matter it is far more a political one and blindly sticking to the letter of the law is really missing forest for the trees.\n\nIt can, of course, be argued that legally (or even logically) speaking the law is either dead or completely outdated - but the legal reality is only a part of the sociopolitical landscape of a country.\n\nShould a democratic government disregard what it perceives to be as general (likely majority) opposition to the repeal of the law that would bring no direct, real benefit to anybody in the society? Including gay people, who can already enjoy their lives in Singapore unharassed anyway?\n\nAs I explained in my article a few months ago, abolition of the law only opens the doors to further demands of activist groups, which never disband but merely change their objectives, endlessly trying to force their vision of the world onto skeptical majority. It\u2019s really an attempt at hijacking democracy by peddling their ideas as some fundamental, undeniable rights, regardless of what most people in the society think about them.\n\nAs long as 377A exists that\u2019s where their activities are focused - what seems to be a balanced political compromise. Activists have a cause to protest against and the discussion stops at it, instead of progressing towards new goals of marriage equality or child adoption, which would inevitably be pursued later.\n\nOf course the government could repeal 377A and replace it with something that would define the reality along the lines accepted by the conservative majority - what would lead to removal of antiquated paragraphs but also, inevitably, to outlawing gay marriage to prevent a rise in other demands.\n\nSuch a move, however, would be bad for everybody. If Singapore took a hard stance on marriage, then its international reputation would likely be hurt, while the reality for gay people in Singapore would not change for the better - they would merely have a different law to oppose now, with far more stronger grounds for its defense in the years to come.\n\nPolitics requires nuance - but law is firm and rigid. Ultimately, however, law is merely a servant of politics and political interests of the country and its society have to take precedence over blind perfectionism in lawmaking.\n\nSo as much as the current compromise is an imperfect one, it is the best for Singapore at this point in time - leaving the doors open to a repeal in the future, once the society\u2019s sentiments change.\n\nIn the meanwhile, activists should be busy trying to convince their fellow compatriots to their cause, instead of seeking loopholes to have their views imposed on everybody, likely leading to more conflicts and less sympathy.\n\nAlas, the paradoxical reality is that there\u2019s a totalitarian in every self-righteous do-gooder - and that can only yield less - not more - tolerance and understanding.", "author": "singaporeing", "created_utc": 1571307289, "score": -0.8344}, {"body": "I met some WP volunteers last year in Bedok; was very impressed by how they're doing their grassroots work.\n\nBig manifestos might grab headlines, but it'll be the grassroots work that win the elections.", "author": "HidingCat", "created_utc": 1571309159, "score": 0.8505}, {"body": "I see PSP and i keep thinking Playstation Portable", "author": "Zeangrydrunk", "created_utc": 1571320106, "score": 0.0}, {"body": "If you don't know who GG is, he runs the website transitioning.org for jobless people, last GE he ran under Reform Party in AMK GRC.

Its dominance in the 1990s to 2000s was more a function of being in the right place at the right time.\n\nFrom Nokia's wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia#History):\n\n&gt;After Finland's trade agreement with the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic [telephone exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange) to [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics) among others; by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. The U.S. government became increasingly suspicious of that co-operation after the end of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) [d\u00e9tente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9tente) in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, [Richard Perle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Perle), Nokia had a secret co-operation with [The Pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon) that allowed the U.S. to keep track of technology developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia#cite_note-24) This was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.\n\nIt is not a good example of how a small country can punch above its weight, because Nokia benefited greatly from Finnish Cold War politics, selling to both East and West.  If today, a Singapore corporation could sell to North Korea and Iran without sanctions, and sell rebranded Huawei phones to the west, it would be a powerhouse immediately.\n\nI think Ikea is actually a better example of a global powerhouse starting from a small country.  Even then, these companies are all statistical outliers and there's a lot of survivorship bias in trying to learn lessons from them.\n\nLots of business people have noted over the years that a successful business needs all the ingredients of great idea, execution, management, people but also luck and timing.   Even Min-Liang, CEO of Razer, acknowledges this in his recent SMU address.\n\nYou might disagree with the Singapore government trying to pick winners by investing heavily in certain sectors at the expense of others, but I doubt the PSP has any brighter ideas.

Assuming that HDB adopts electric charging stations in HDBs, most people will be charging their EVs during the night, and not the day. The electricity grid currently handles a peak demand of 7500MWh, and this drops to \\~5500MWh during midnight to 6am. This means that by adopting EVs, it will help to better balance the electricity grid by allowing a more constant usage of electricity given every hour. And lets say theres truly a 50% adoption of EV, thus \\~400k EVs in the road (Total number of cars now is at \\~900k, according to COE). Lets say most EVs have a milage of 350km, and thus need charging every 3 weeks, with a battery capacity of 75KW. Thus, on a average night cycle, 1450 Megawatt is used. Compared to the above figure on energy usage, Singapore's grid certainly can handle it.\n2. Yes, charging facilities are a issue, but isn't it easy to allow the free market to capitalize on this, like in the USA with Tesla charging facilities, etc. ? If HDB can sell charging facilities to the energy retailers for a fee, it could even profit easily.\n3. Currently, there are a few, but mostly hybrid. But given how viable EV cars are currently, its a matter of time EV vans/trucks come. Yet, its not really the question on \"Should all cars be replaced by EV, or all be fossil fuel\", but the gradual change we should do to replace fossil fuel cars to EVs.\n4. \\^\\^\n5.

All that is required is for the fiduciary to have known that his actions were not in his principal\u2019s interests, or to have been reckless as to the same. In other words, only a purely negligent or entirely innocent breach of fiduciary duties would fall outside the scope of \u201cfraud\u201d under s 22(1) (a). It is clear from my analysis of the facts that the breach of fiduciary duties in the present case could not have been purely negligent or entirely innocent. Acting for improper purposes and in deliberate violation of the TCFR (see [300] above) must fit easily within this definition of fraud. Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Low Thia Khiang\u2019s breach of fiduciary duties thus falls within s 22(1)(a) of the Limitation Act and is therefore not time-barred.\"", "author": "HarukiMurakarma", "created_utc": 1572959978, "score": -0.529}, {"body": "This I fully agree with you.

Fixated on his undoubtedly right-wing political affiliations, and nostalgic for the old Japan, which happily professed its pacifism and was so gratifyingly deferential to them individually, too many US diplomats contrived to miss the often very progressive substance of Abe\u2019s actual policies, and their advantages from the US point of view. For example, until he succeeded in changing an absurdly restrictive constitutional interpretation made by long-retired officials (not by constitutional judges), Japan\u2019s self-defence forces relied fully on American support in the event of combat, but were forbidden to provide any support whatever to US forces. As I noted to some of Abe\u2019s officials at the time, had this fact been known to the American public it would have provoked demands to abrogate the US-Japan security treaty.\nOpposition to Abe has always made much of his membership of Nippon Kaigi, or \u2018Japan Conference\u2019, a gathering of politicians and intellectuals who want to preserve the symbolic importance of the emperor (\u2018the imperial institution\u2019), traditional family values, the \u2018imperial Shinto\u2019 of the national shrines (as opposed to the diffused nature worship of local shrines), patriotism and patriotic education in schools, and, above all, the emancipation of Japan from Article 9 of the postwar constitution:\n\n(1) Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. (2) In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognised.\n\nThese words make Japan the only country in the world that is legally prohibited from defending itself. Three and a bit years after the new constitution came into effect on 3 May 1947, North Korean forces invaded the South, all available US occupation troops were rushed to hold a collapsing front, and in defenceless Japan the supreme supremo General MacArthur, whose men had drafted Article 9, ordered the quick build-up of an army in all but name \u2013 a National Police Reserve of 75,000 men, whose tanks were called \u2018special vehicles\u2019. A de facto navy (Coastal Safety Force) followed in 1952, and more units were added bit by bit until in 1954 the Self-Defence Forces Act legalised a very slow rearmament that has continued to this day, though always under very tight spending limits \u2013 less than 1 per cent of GDP.\n\nArticle 9 was thus subverted by its own sponsors, and as the Cold War continued successive US administrations and their Tokyo envoys welcomed Japan\u2019s rearmament, and indeed often wished for more. But they never supported the rewriting of the constitution \u2013 mostly because the envoys were usually liberals vehemently opposed to right-wing Japanese. They tended to lump together three very different groups: true extremists who still defended Japan\u2019s wars of conquest and blame everything on the Americans, including Pearl Harbor (forced on Japan by the American oil embargo, according to them); sinister poseurs mostly fronting for organised crime if not criminals themselves; and Japan\u2019s Tories, exemplified by the courtly, highly literate Kase Hideaki, never a politician but a mentor to many and Abe\u2019s friend, whose views are by no means immoderate. (\u2018We are dedicated to our conservative cause. We are monarchists. We are for revising the constitution. We are for the glory of the nation.\u2019) Recently, one more principle has become more important: the need to increase Japan\u2019s defensive strength to counterbalance China, North Korea and other hostile powers, though Nippon Kaigi\u2019s manifesto also includes such non-nationalist calls as \u2018building friendly relations with foreign countries through social and cultural exchange programmes\u2019.\n\n\nBut more than their words, there is a particular ritual that has periodically mobilised the enemies of Nippon Kaigi and the Japanese right: the visits of politicians to the Yasukuni shrine, which adds a tendentious Second World War museum to Shinto\u2019s normal accoutrements, as well as housing jars containing the ashes of war veterans and worthies dating back to the Meiji restoration. In 1966 jars containing the ashes of 14 prominent wartime generals and ministers \u2013 including Tojo Hideki, of Hitler-like fame in his day \u2013 who had all been condemned as Class A war criminals by the allies, reached the Yasukuni. Nothing was said or done about them until 1978, when a very right-wing new head priest, Nagayoshi Matsudaira, \u2018enshrined\u2019 the Class A war criminals in a secret ceremony, in effect including them among the deities to be worshipped. Word soon leaked out and Hirohito, along with many Japanese politicians, refused to visit the shrine. But for members of Nippon Kaigi periodic public visits are a must, though Abe is exempted from the obligation because of his broader responsibilities.\n\nFor the South Koreans, who 74 years after the end of the occupation still cannot forgive the Japanese as the French and Russians forgave the Germans, for the very good reason that most Koreans collaborated (former president Park Chung-hee, father of Abe\u2019s counterpart Park Geun-hye, was once the fervently loyal Masao Takagi of the Japanese army), visits to the Yasukuni shrine by Japanese politicians are opportunities for highly ritualised outbursts of anti-Japanese feeling \u2013 rather a luxury for a country that depends on Japanese bases for its defence. For the Chinese, who keep producing anti-Japanese war films and fake newsreels, to ward off the dangers of mass tourism to Japan, where too many friendly encounters might ruin years of indoctrination, politicians\u2019 visits to the Yasukuni shrine offer opportunities for retellings of the wartime story, none of which need mention the fact that Mao and his minions outdid the Japanese at least three to one in killing Chinese.\n\nAmbassador Kennedy protested in December 2013 when Abe visited the shrine to reward his Nippon Kaigi supporters (who stood by him when he was out of office between 2007 and 2012), charging that Abe\u2019s actions would \u2018exacerbate tensions\u2019 with Japan\u2019s neighbours. That was an interesting observation, considering South Korea\u2019s non-stop hostility, and China\u2019s frequent provocations, including the widespread anti-Japanese protests of 2010, which were triggered by official media misrepresentations of the Japanese arrest of a drunken Chinese trawler captain who had tried to ram Japanese patrol boats. Kennedy\u2019s complaint hardly worsened Obama\u2019s policies: his administration did not even protest against China\u2019s devastation of vast coral reefs to build military bases. But the US embassy\u2019s hostility did generate an uninterrupted flow of sceptical or outrightly hostile stories in the US press that profoundly misrepresented both Abe and Japan. Pyle is not in Abe\u2019s camp, but he is not against it either. His Abe is the one I know, a pragmatic Japanese Tory driving through reforms at home, while weaving an alliance aimed at containing China, with Australia, Vietnam and India in the lead, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia in tow, Canada looking in, and the United States as the backstop. These reactions to Chinese expansionism \u2013 all those territorial claims, from Japan\u2019s very small islands to eighty thousand square kilometres of north-east India \u2013 are entirely normal, the elemental logic of strategy at work.

What's clear from press reports even in ST is that it's more than just separatists (which imply militancy) . But given the terms used, including \"re-education camps\" and \"mass detentions\" these appear to be targeted at people with differing political views. To use an analogy (as limited as it is), it's like if we sent any WP supporters to a camp to re-educate them accordingly.

If they were indeed rioters it would not be a problem for China to throw them in jail. But the problem now is that they're likely only sympathetic to the idea of separation without more.

It is entirely appropriate, at this juncture, to reiterate a point we have already made several times in the course of this judgment, not least because it is an extremely important and fundamental one: the court can only consider legal (as opposed to extra-legal) arguments. This ensures that it will not become a \u201cmini-legislature\u201d. The court cannot - and must not \u2014 assume legislative functions which are necessarily beyond its remit.

Worse still, it would necessarily be involved in expressing views on extra-legal issues which would - in the nature of things - be (or at least be perceived to be) subjective in nature.

There are racist overtones, but these are bound to appear within interactions between people of different cultures.\n\n&gt;I'm also going to take a bet that this post is going to far more downvoted than those with the persecution complex regarding being downvoted for speaking the truth. \n\nThe reasons you will get downvoted are because this seems to be the rant of a very sensitive and tilted person, and not a discussion as stated in the title.\n\ntl:dr There is no far-reaching, conspiracy agenda against Indians in r/sg. There is however, overt discrimination in our daily lives against non-chinese people in Singapore. There is also a stereotype of Indian nationals, which OP admitted may be true, on which part of the discrimination is based on.
