He met the local chieftain ,Temenggong Abdul Rahman, and worked out an arrangement for the British to establish a port on the unpopulated island of Singapore.\n\n&gt; Dr John Crawfurd recorded that prior to Raffles&amp;apos; arrival, \"for a period of about five hundred years and a half, there is no record of Singapore having been occupied, and it was only the occasional resort of pirates\". As the second Resident of Singapore in 1823, Crawfurd would be an authority on the founding of Singapore.\n\n&gt; Crawfurd was also aware of an earlier settlement on Singapore which he systematically recorded the remains of, on a visit to Singapore in 1822. He knew from the Portuguese records that this settlement was abandoned at the end of the 14th century and inferred that Singapore was deserted for the next five centuries and a half until Raffles arrived.\n\n&gt; Archaeological excavations in 1984, and in the following three decades around Fort Canning confirmed Crawfurd&amp;apos;s observations of the remains of a 14th-century regional entrepot engaged in a thriving trade with China under the Yuan dynasty.\n\n&gt; The archaeological evidence also indicates that the settlement was abandoned at the end of the 14th century, when Malacca was founded and rose to become the lead emporium in the Malacca Strait.\n\n&gt; This then has been the underlying assumption of Singapore&amp;apos;s history, that Singapore was founded as a British colony on an unpopulated island. The prevailing narrative is that even if there is evidence of earlier settlement on this island, it was sporadic and has no connection, and is thus irrelevant, to Raffles&amp;apos; arrival in Singapore and the subsequent success of the settlement he founded.\n\n&gt; Next year is the bicentenary of Singapore&amp;apos;s \"founding\" as a British entrepot city. The challenge will be whether residents in this city can remain alert and respond to the forces of change in the region and wider world to survive and celebrate its centenary of independence 47 years from now in 2065, says the writer. ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM\n\n&gt; Such a construction of Singapore&amp;apos;s past, however, disregards Portuguese and Dutch reports of a thriving harbour in Singapore in the late 16th and early 17th century which was controlled by a harbour master or shabandar appointed by the Sultan of Johor in his capital up the Johor River, in Kota Tinggi or Johor Lama and especially in Batu Sawar.\n\n&gt; Portuguese and Dutch maps mark a harbour under a shabandar at either the Singapore River or the Kallang River. The missionary Francis Xavier called at this harbour in Singapore on his travels in the mid-16th century to China and back to Malacca, and was able to dispatch letters from the harbour. The Portuguese trader Jacques de Coutre, who travelled extensively around the region from 1593 to 1603, provides the most explicit reference to this harbour he called at, and described as \"one of the best that serves the Indies\".\n\n&gt; The Dutch East India Company&amp;apos;s Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jong met this shabandar, who claimed to represent the Sultan of Johor, in 1606 to negotiate a Johor-Dutch alliance to attack the Portuguese in Malacca. Both the Dutch and the Portuguese recognised the strategic location of Singapore for the security of their ships sailing to trade in China, and planned to construct forts in Singapore to protect the waterways for their ships. Singapore&amp;apos;s history would have taken a rather different course if either the Portuguese or Dutch had the resources to construct the forts they planned on the island.\n\n&gt; Crawfurd and generations of historians following him were right that there was no continuous settlement in Singapore prior to Raffles&amp;apos; arrival. But this is to ignore the argument for cycles of settlement on Singapore, of which there were at least three.\n\n&gt; The first cycle of settlement was 14th-century Temasek which survived on Yuan China trade with the South Seas, and declined with the Yuan. Temasek&amp;apos;s eclipse as a port continued through the century of Malacca, when it was a homeland for the sea nomad warriors of the sultans of Malacca.\n\n&gt; The second cycle of settlement on Singapore was with the scions of the Malacca sultans after they lost their emporium to the Portuguese in 1511. They established a port in Singapore to serve the thriving riverine trade of the Johor River they controlled from their upstream capitals. This shabandar in Singapore thrived on Johor&amp;apos;s riverine trade with Ming China and other Malacca Strait ports.\n\n&gt; It was abandoned when a new line of Johor sultans moved their capital from upstream Johor to Tanjong Pinang on Bintan island in what is now Indonesia.\n\n&gt; Raffles arrived in 1819 on a depopulated island to build the third cycle of settlement in Singapore. Like the earlier two cycles of settlement, Raffles&amp;apos; settlement rose to pre-eminence within 30 years of its establishment, despite the lack of support from the East India Company, which provided minimal administrative help and funding for the running of its settlement. But unlike the earlier two cycles of settlement, it survived its centenary and is due to celebrate its bicentennial next year.\n\n&gt; The colonial port city Raffles established has, however, been changing since 1965, when Singapore became a sovereign nation. In that sense, its fourth cycle of settlement can be said to date from that year. Just as the settlement in 1819 was not expected to survive the opposition of the Dutch and lack of support from the East India Company , so too Singapore after 1965, which survived against the odds.\n\n&gt; Singapore&amp;apos;s success was in large part because, with the other anti-communist nations of the region, it was able to bandwagon with the United States and Japan to receive investments, aid and technology, and access to their markets.\n\n&gt; It regionalised its economy after 1989 and aspired to become a global city, networking with other global cities, including London, New York, Tokyo and Shanghai.\n\n&gt; Was the end of the Cold War also the end of the cycle of globalisation dominated by the United States? Is the region at the beginning of another cycle of globalisation to be driven by a \"peaceful rising\" China?\n\n&gt; Within the long cycles of trade, China, under the Tang, Song and Ming dynasties, has driven earlier cycles of trade and prosperity in the region. It was Yuan and Ming maritime trade which enabled in part the first and second cycles of settlement in Singapore.\n\n&gt; It appears that Singapore&amp;apos;s current cycle of development may be dependent on access to China&amp;apos;s market and the One Belt One Road which China is now pioneering.\n\n&gt; In 2015, Singapore celebrated the half century of its current fourth cycle of development, after it became a sovereign state. Next year, 2019, is the bicentenary of Singapore&amp;apos;s \"founding\" as a British entrepot city.\n\n&gt; As we look back at our past and come to understand the periods of settlement of this island-city better, the challenge will be whether residents in this city can remain alert and respond to the forces of change in the region and wider world to survive and celebrate its centenary of independence in 2065, 47 years from now.\n\n&gt; \u2022 Kwa Chong Guan is the author of the recently published Pre-Colonial Singapore, in the series Singapore Chronicles co-published by the Institute of Policy Studies and the Straits Times Press.\n\n&gt; [Source](http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/700-years-of-history-a-bicentennial-and-four-cycles-of-settlement)\n\n---\nv4.0 | [Github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [Readme/Changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/README.md) | Summon me: `/u/rsg-retrivr summon`\n", "author": "rsg-retrivr", "created_utc": 1515113644, "score": 0.9951}, {"body": "Am I supposed to feel disturbed that even before the GE they already assume they will have majority in Parliament and therefore have the PM from their side?\n\nI mean yes the odds are pretty high on the them retaining , given the lack of decent opposition.\n\nBut isnt this taking their political position for granted?

Contrary to some online claims, the OPP was not introduced as part of the SG50 celebrations to honour our seniors. The fact is, less than 1% of seniors who held concession cards purchased the OPP.\n\n2. The OPP was discontinued as it was not effective, and notice was given on 30 October 2017.\n\nThe trial found that fewer than 200 commuters changed their travel pattern to travel at off-peak periods. Given that the OPP trial was not effective, the PTC recommended that it be discontinued. Instead, PTC recommended that all commuters enjoy a fare discount of up to 50 cents throughout the rail network if they tap in before 7.45am. Senior citizens and persons with disabilities enjoy this discount on top of their regular 25% discounts.\n\nThese changes were announced with wide publicity as part of PTC\u2019s Fare Review Exercise on 30 October 2017. Besides extensive reports carried by major media outlets and on social media (e.g. here, here and here), posters were also placed at MRT stations and on buses. \n\n3. Senior citizens enjoy 25% discount on fares at all times, and get an additional 25% off when they travel before 7.45am.\n\nSenior citizens enjoy a fare discount of about 25% on our public transport network at all times. In addition, the $60 Senior Citizen Monthly Concession Pass, which allows unlimited travel on basic buses and trains throughout the day, is half the price of an Adult Monthly Travel Pass.\n\nThe PTC also introduced lower morning pre-peak fares (a fare discount of up to 50 cents for all commuters if they tap in before 7.45am) for the entire rail network starting 29 December 2017, which benefits more than 300,000 commuters.

Safety is the number 1 thing that everyone will tell U yet most of us just brush it off. Personally I've seen pple use wallets, mobile phones, bags, laptops to chope seats at hawker centres. I used to think its no big deal until, I've had my wallet stolen twice in Europe(Paris, Moscow), once in Argentina, bag and passport got stolen in Milan and almost got robbed in Amsterdam. Really puts things into perspective.\n\nAnother thing is food. We never really realize how good we have it with food until U get stuck in the same country eating the same thing over and over and over again for weeks/months. I was once stuck in a rural part of India eating curry and naan/roti 3 meals a day for 1 month straight. Their idea of different dishes is they give u a different kind of curry/gravy to go with the bread. Even Japan, easily my fav country, U soon realize the variety is lacking after an extended stay. We totally take for granted the sheer variety and quality of the food we have in SG, it is simply amazing.\n\nWe complain about traffic jam all the time. I realize our so called traffic jam is just slower traffic(it's not even that slow) during peak hours. We almost never get any real traffic jam, the type that almost comes to a complete standstill unless there is some insane traffic accident, those kind of traffic jams are every day occurrence in places like KL, Jakarta, even freaking Paris. I was once stuck between Jakarta and a town call Berkasi for 4.5hr(according to the local its common on Fridays), the same trip takes 30 min in normal traffic conditions. Funny story on our public transport, some of my Malaysian ex-colleauge thinks our public transport is a form of Welfare from the govt. They have no choice but to suffer in endless traffic jams and spend a good chunk of their income maintaining a car\n\nSG is not expensive. Yes I actually say that. I always thought SG was expensive until I started traveling and talking to the locals in their respective countries. Really put into perspective how inexpensive SG actually is for most of us locals. Most Asian countries are cheap only because of a strong SGD. In almost every single instance, I found that we were better off compared to someone earning their local wages. Even compared to Europe, half the time we were better off. I always thought the Europeans earn a lot more than us, I was wrong\n\nThe free healthcare, free whatever that the European gets isn't as good as it sounds especially after I found out their wages isn't that high and their tax is insanely high. Compared to them, we barely pay any taxes, we only really pay taxes if annual income exceeds $80K, I was still paying like $1K(I think) when my income was still $70K. It's not like SG medical is expensive, not for locals anyway. I pay like $40-50 a month in insurance and between that, the govt subsidies and medisave, I don't pay a single cent when I visit the hospital\n\nThe so called freedom they enjoyed isn't all that they made it out to be. Freedom of speech even in Europe is actually restricted in 1 way or the other.

In constructing the index, we aim to provide a proxy indicator for the cost of living to understand the characteristics of different neighbourhoods in Singapore. The prices of seven food items (rice with two vegetables and one meat option, rice with one vegetable and two meat options,\u00a0nasi goreng, chicken rice, chicken biryani, iced Milo, and black coffee with sugar) were surveyed in over 100 locations across 26 neighbourhoods. The Index was then correlated against socio-economic characteristics of the neighbourhood, such as proportion of rental flats, age profile (residents above 65 years old), and households with more than S$10,000 in monthly income. \n\n&gt;According to the Makan Index, the most expensive zones are Bishan, Marine Parade and Sembawang, while the cheapest zones are Bukit Merah, Queenstown and Toa Payoh. Food prices can differ by nearly 20% between neighbourhoods. Food prices are not necessarily uniformly higher the closer one is to the city centre. The variability is instead accounted for by socio-economic indicators of the neighbourhoods. \n\n&gt;Based on correlation analysis, we found that the Makan Index is negatively correlated with the age of estates, proportion of tenants, proportion of divorced and separated persons, proportion of people living without a family nucleus, and proportion of elderly aged 65 and above. The Index is positively correlated with the proportion of households with at least one family nucleus and three generations. This suggests that the cost of food is lower in mature estates and areas with more socio-economically vulnerable people. In areas where such resident profiles are prevalent, food prices are more affordable.

You have raw recruits like the Australians and the Punjabis supported by a small core of highly trained veterans like the Highlanders. Poor coordination between fresh troops led to a very bad showing of a gradual withdrawal. On the front lines, companies would withdraw long before their alloted times, leaving flanks open and allowing overruns to occur. The Japanese capture of aerodromes was not entirely due to spies, as panicky RAF personnel abandoned positions before destroying supplies. On the battle of Singapore, there was absolutely no reason why the coastal guns were pointed the wrong way. They were 381mm and had the range to bombard the Japanese buildup in Johore. Again, poor troops and poor commanders failed the British, as Bennet fled to Australia early on and lack of coordination due to cut telephone lines led to massed withdrawals towards the city area. This isn't to say that the troops were bad. Several successes were made especially in terms of artillery and AT warfare on the part of the Australians, who destroyed several light tank forces at chokepoints in the dense jungle with 0 losses, in part thanks to the excellent 25pdr gun howitzer, which could act as both artillery and AT gun.\n\nTL:DR mothership gets everything wrong again.

The median gross wage of a hairdresser was $3,099 as of June 2016, going by the latest figures available.\n\n&gt; Official data shows that the hairdressing trade is growing and observers say there is room to take in high earnings with healthy demand for more diverse hair services.\n\n&gt; Hair-salon owner Jeanie McLean, 37, says: \"People are more willing to pay to look good. Even men are spending more money on grooming.\"\n\n&gt; There&amp;apos;s no documentation to say this is a qualified hairstylist or a leading hairstylist. There&amp;apos;s no licensing or regulation.\n\n&gt; MR SIMON LEE, founder of the Hair &amp; Cosmetology Association (Singapore) (Hacos), on issues of concern in the hairdressing industry\n\n&gt; At Urban Tress Salon in King Albert Park, she offers a range of services, such as hair straightening, neon highlights and ombre hair colouring, where one hue blends into another.\n\n&gt; But beneath this shine and gloss lie hairy issues that impact consumers, according to industry veterans interviewed by The Sunday Times.\n\n&gt; Income earned from business operations in the hairdressing industry rose from $338.4 million in 2014 to $401.1 million in 2016, an increase of 18.5 per cent in two years, according to figures from the Singapore Department of Statistics.\n\n&gt; Mr Simon Lee, founder of the Hair &amp; Cosmetology Association (Singapore) (Hacos), notes, however, that earnings can range widely.\n\n&gt; He estimates that a seasoned hairstylist can earn about $10,000 a month and that even higher incomes can be made by big-name veterans or salon owners who charge a few thousand dollars for hair services.\n\n&gt; In contrast, entering the trade as an apprentice, who starts off shampooing hair and preparing chemical hair treatments, can mean a meagre wage of $1,200 a month, an amount that discourages newbies from seeing a future in the trade, says Mr Lee, 52.\n\n&gt; He says that earnings can fluctuate widely because of a common industry practice: Many workers are paid a basic wage and earn commission, determined by the salon they work in, for their hairdressing services, as well as for products they sell to their customers.\n\n&gt; This means that ultra-low prices for hairdressing services - a bugbear for many of the hairstylists interviewed - can be compensated by commission earned, adds Mr Lee. He cites a haircut that costs less than $4 as an example of a below-average price.\n\n&gt; Some hairstylists seek to earn more commission by hard-selling their clients packages that offer a set of pre-paid hair services, which can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. This has potential implications for consumers pressured into buying such packages.\n\n&gt; Mr Lawrence Koh, 57, founder of Le Salon Prive in Lucky Plaza shopping centre, says: \"It&amp;apos;s quite messy. Customers may be asked to take up unnecessary hair treatments.\"\n\n&gt; Mr Koh, who does not offer such packages at his salon, has 40 years&amp;apos; experience in hairdressing.\n\n&gt; In 2015, a hair salon chain closed down, leaving hundreds of consumers with unused packages that they had paid for.\n\n&gt; The Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) received close to 500 complaints that year about hair salons, including around 200 complaints from customers of The Scissorhands and its affiliate Shizahanzu, the chain which shut abruptly in August 2015, reports said.\n\n&gt; The following year, in 2016, Case and Hacos signed a memorandum of understanding for an accreditation scheme for the hair industry to prevent a repeat of such incidents.\n\n&gt; Salons that sign up voluntarily have to meet strict criteria, such as training staff not to hard sell and having appropriate hygiene guidelines.\n\n&gt; One of the salons that signed up for this accreditation last year was Tresses Studio in Ghim Moh.\n\n&gt; Its director, Mr Kenny Chew, 52, who has been in the business for 30 years, says he sought the accreditation so that his customers would feel more secure.\n\n&gt; For instance, the products he uses at his salon are all approved for use by the Health Sciences Authority. Unlike some other salons, his does not use keratin hair-smoothing treatments that have formaldehyde, a carcinogen.\n\n&gt; Another concern in the hairdressing industry is professionalism, insiders say.\n\n&gt; Hacos&amp;apos; Mr Lee says there is a lack of regulation for hairdressers, who do not need a licence to practise.\n\n&gt; \"There&amp;apos;s no documentation to say this is a qualified hairstylist or a leading hairstylist. There&amp;apos;s no licensing or regulation. For hawkers, for example, they have A, B, C, D grades, indicating hygiene standards, but we don&amp;apos;t have such standards in the industry,\" he says.\n\n&gt; Other hairdressing veterans, however, are optimistic about the continued growth of the industry.\n\n&gt; \"Our services have grown a lot. We have more knowledge,\" says Mr Gary Chew, 44, founder and director of Mi the Salon and the Salon Vim outlets.\n\n&gt; He cites services such as balayage, a technique where dye is painted on the hair for a graduated effect; treatments that protect hair cuticles and hair contouring, which is inspired by contouring make-up and purportedly accentuates or softens one&amp;apos;s facial features.\n\n&gt; Young people, from the age of 18 to the early 20s, are driving demand for \"experimental looks\" involving unusual hair colours, but older professionals are a more significant factor in the industry&amp;apos;s boom, he says.\n\n&gt; \"This demographic are those already on a career path, who are aged from their 20s to 40s. They want to look fresh at work,\" says Mr Gary Chew, who has designed hair treatments, offering gloss and body, for his business.\n\n&gt; He also offers personalised scalp treatments, as well as manicure and pedicure services while customers get their hair cut.\n\n&gt; Such diversified services are \"one of the ways to innovate the salon business\", he says, adding that the secret to good business is to treat customers well. \"You have to learn the craft and you also have to wait on people. It&amp;apos;s about emotions and how the clients feel.\"\n\n&gt; In her 16 years in the hairdressing trade, Mrs Jeanie McLean, 37, did well - a bad month for her would mean $6,000 in earnings.\n\n&gt; The mother of one, who recently opened her own hair salon, started as a shampoo girl at the age of about 20, after completing a course in a hairdressing school.\n\n&gt; Within six months, she had progressed to cutting hair and soon had a regular pool of clients.\n\n&gt; After a few years working full time at a Far East Plaza salon, Mrs McLean switched to a part-time role to spend more time with her daughter, now aged 11. The Singaporean is married to a 40-year-old Scottish businessman.\n\n&gt; Back then, even working three days a week, from 11am to 8.30pm, earned her at least $6,000 a month. Occasionally, she even earned $12,000 a month, she says.\n\n&gt; During peak periods such as the run-up to Chinese New Year, she could earn $18,000 a month, she adds.\n\n&gt; The sale of packages, services pre-sold in bulk to customers at a discounted price, helped her earn such wages as she received a commission rate of 30 per cent of the total sales.\n\n&gt; It is not unusual, says Mrs McLean, for women here to have a couple of such packages and visit a salon twice a week for services such as hair cutting, colouring, washing and blow-drying, or hair treatments.\n\n&gt; \"My clientele introduced me to their friends and I gained clients through such word of mouth,\" she says. \"Once you prove your skills to your clients, they trust you. They know you are not trying to rip them off.\"\n\n&gt; It helps that she is a \"good listener\", she says.\n\n&gt; Sometimes, women come to the salon not because they need their hair cut but because they need some space for themselves or to talk, she says.\n\n&gt; Mrs McLean, who says she is ready to work harder now that her daughter is older, set up her own salon, Urban Tress, at King Albert Park in October last year.\n\n&gt; She charges $45 for a cut, wash and blow dry and highlights start at $150.\n\n&gt; Last month, the salon earned a net profit of $10,000, she says, adding that running a business has always been her goal. She still has clients from the time she started 16 years ago.\n\n&gt; [Source](http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/cutting-edge-profession)\n\n---\nv4.0 | [Github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [Readme/Changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/README.md) | Summon me: `/u/rsg-retrivr summon`\n", "author": "rsg-retrivr", "created_utc": 1518932647, "score": 0.9928}, {"body": "Something like [this](http://hairstylezz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dark-to-Light-Brown-Ombre-1-650x813.jpg)?", "author": "JPJP_", "created_utc": 1518944048, "score": 0.3612}, {"body": "can this matter be taken to court? will WP do so?\n\n", "author": "ugly_male", "created_utc": 1519015692, "score": 0.4927}, {"body": "The whole \"I mistakenly topped up $50 when I only want to top up $10\" isn't even an issue at all.

Weak literacy and numeracy skills\n\n&gt; Excelling in Mathematics and English is critical for students to do well in school, especially at the primary and secondary levels. However, despite the introduction of mastery programmes by Malay/Muslim organisations (MMOs) to tackle Malay students\u2019 weakness in English and Mathematics, feedback from educators suggests that many Malay students still lack\na strong foundation in these subjects. As reflected in the statistics, the numerous Math-based programmes and English reading headstart programmes have yet to make a significant impact in improving the situation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ii. Lack of socio-emotional competencies for sustained academic success\n\n&gt; Feedback from teachers also suggests that Malay students generally do not exercise productive habits of mind in their daily school work.Traits such as diligence, resilience and perseverance appear to be lacking among many Malay students. Many remain unmotivated and uninspired to do well in school. There is a need for students to be more attuned to current educational realities in order to survive in an increasingly competitive world. Parents and guardians should also be more involved in their children\u2019s/wards\u2019 learning process.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; iii. Self-defeatist vision of academic success\n\n&gt; Recent findings from a perception study commissioned by AMP in 2011, provide us with a clearer picture of Malays\u2019 \u2018self-defeatist\u2019 perceptions of academic success. Below are some pertinent data:\n\n&gt; \u2022 73% of Malay/Muslim parents feel that the cost of education is an obstacle that might affect their children\u2019s ability to succeed. These parents also feel that their children\u2019s grades might not be good enough for them to gain entry into tertiary institutions and that they will also face competition for places in the local universities.\n\n&gt; \u2022 52% of Malay/Muslim parents think that it is not realistic for them to send their children overseas to study in a foreign university. A majority of them cited financial affordability as the main reason.\n\n&gt; \u2022 Almost half of the parents who participated in the survey mentioned that the lack of interest or ambition in their children might impede their ability to obtain university education. Even more worryingly, 25% of parents said that their children do not want to go to a university.\n\n&gt; \u2022 The survey found that 68% of parents claimed they were involved in their children\u2019s education. Such claims, however, were inconsistent with their actual involvement in activities relating to their children\u2019s education. For example, more than 70% said they are not involved in ensuring homework routines and habits are maintained. Additionally, 90% of them said they do not help their children prepare for exams and tests or provide additional home learning/education.\n\n&gt; \u2022 Almost 50% of Malay/Muslim parents do not enroll their children in courses outside school hours. Most said they do not see the need for it or that they are unable to afford the money for these courses. These responses reveal that certain self-limiting beliefs and mindsets may be responsible for educational\nunderachievement among the Malays. Families that do not encourage their children to excel academically will eventually fail to break out of a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of self-fulfilling prophecies about educational underperformance.

According to the table on pages 19-21 of guidelines for the [FASS modular system for the cohort of 2017](https://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/images/doc-pdf/doc/undergrad/modular_system/modular-2017.pdf), approximately 47.5% of the modules that you take (if you are pursuing a Single Major Honours degree ) would be from outside of your major. These include Unrestricted Electives (22.5%), modules that you can take from almost any faculty (including [YNC](http://ourcors.yale-nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2015/01/FAQS-for-NUS-Students-Reading-Yale-NUS-Modules.pdf)), General Education modules (12.5%), Faculty Core (12.5%). If you are not pursuing an Honours Degree, the percentage of modules that you take from your major can be as low as 36.7%. The percentages for Double Major with Honours (Primary major: 50%; second major: 26.2%) and Double Major without Honours (Primary major: 34.4%; second major: 34.4%) also indicate that a significant proportion of your modules will be from outside of your primary major. \n\nIf you compare these figures with [YNC's curriculum](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/student-experience/): Common Curriculum (31%), Electives (35%), Majors &amp; Capstones (34%), the importance that NUS FASS and YNC give to non-major modules is surprisingly similar. If you are looking for breadth, NUS FASS can be an option to consider as well. Moreover, like in YNC, you do not have to choose your major(s) or minor(s) in your first year of study. I cannot recall exactly when you have to declare your major in FASS but I think it is sometime during your second year of study. \n\nIn terms of exposure to diverse viewpoints, it would be important to note that the number of students in most of NUS's faculties far exceeds the student population of YNC. This means that you will probably meet different people in each of your non-major modules unlike in YNC where you may end up seeing the same students in your classes. Thus, it is possible that you may be exposed to more diverse viewpoints in FASS than in YNC.\n\nI am not familiar with SMU or NTU since I have not studied at these institutions before. While I am quite pro-NUS when it comes to choosing between NUS and YNC, I still believe that there is merit in choosing to apply to YNC. Naturally the merits of each course depends on what you want to receive from your university education and YNC may be the better choice for you. However, I think it is important to study the specifics of each course and what each university has to offer in detail as the plethora of options that the each university has can create very unique and exciting experiences for different students. Personally, I am a NUS FASS student who may be spending more than a quarter (4/11 semesters) of my university education overseas (I am not on a joint or double degree programme).

A committee spokesman said about half of the owners attended the last meeting and 90 per cent of them are in favour for the sale.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, Golden Mile Complex, which has already formed its collective sale committee, held its last meeting on Feb 7. The agenda included appointing a valuer for existing units. Marketing agent Edmund Tie and Company is managing its collective sale bid.\n\n&gt;The neighbouring Golden Mile Tower, designed by architect Goh Hock Guan and his team, is also in the process of forming a collective sale committee and is due to hold an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday.\n\n&gt;Of the four, People's Park Complex, Golden Mile Complex and Golden Mile Tower are widely recognised by experts as architecturally and historically significant.\n\n&gt;The trio were inspired by the Brutalist-architectural movement. The style usually features monumental structures made of off-form concrete without being plastered over, for an appearance of \"strength and solidity\".\n\n&gt;The three were completed as part of the Government's first Land Sales Programme beginning in 1967 where land parcels were offered for sale with a leasehold of 99 years.\n\n&gt;Mr Randy Chan, principal of architecture firm Zarch Collaboratives, said: \"We were building mega-structures like these fresh out of independence.\"\n\n&gt;This slew of attempts en bloc follows news last month that the striking horseshoe-shaped Pearl Bank Apartments near Outram Park MRT station had been sold to CapitaLand in a $782 million collective sale. Launched in 1976, the development will likely be torn down.\n\n&gt;Unit owners at People's Park Complex told The Straits Times that they are eager to sell the property \"if the price is right\".\n\n&gt;The owner of Golden Watch Gold and Jewellery at People's Park Complex, who wanted to be known only as Mr Kea, 75, admitted the structure is special. However, he said: \"Just like an ageing person, an old building will have its issues. As long as the selling price is reasonable, it can move undecided owners.\"\n\n&gt;Mr Kea has been at the complex since 1988. He said the sentiments among parties present were split down the middle with two camps for and against the collective sale bid.\n\n&gt;However, second-generation co-owner of Hang Lung Jewellery, Mr Henry Ho, 47, said his family is not interested in selling its shop and the idea of a shinier and new development is not exactly enticing. He noted that business is thriving, with heavy traffic for stalls on the ground level which might mean that some owners, like himself, would be reluctant to give up the space.\n\n&gt;The complex, which was completed in 1973, is located next to an exit of the Chinatown MRT station.\n\n&gt;Mr Ho said: \"We've been here for about 40 years. Business is good enough. Our roots are here - it's where my father started his business. Compared to an Orchard Road Mall, it's not as swanky but there are tourists here and we are surviving.\"\n\n&gt;The firm behind People's Park Complex was Design Partnership or DP Architects. The team comprised pioneer architects William Lim, Koh Seow Chuan and Tay Kheng Soon.\n\n&gt;The complex is home to a podium of shops and offices, as well as a 25-storey residential block. Occupying 1ha, it was once the largest shopping complex in Singapore. It also featured the country's first atrium shopping centre for residents and other users in the community to socialise, eat and shop.\n\n&gt;This design was widely replicated in later local and regional retail developments.\n\n&gt;Dr Yeo Kang Shua, an architectural historian and conservator, noted that People's Park Complex \"conceptually contributed to the development of architecture, hence its place in history\".\n\n&gt;The complex is also recognised as one of the first successful urban revitalisation projects in the nation and challenged the concept of single-use zoning.\n\n&gt;DP Architects also designed Golden Mile Complex. The team comprised Gan Eng Oon, William Lim and Tay Kheng Soon.\n\n&gt;Mr Alan Lim, who is in his 70s, owns an office space there. He said he is looking to sell his unit. \"It is a collective sale market, everybody is trying to sell. The faster, the better. I am looking to retire so this will be timely.\"\n\n&gt;The owner of Hong Giap Credit at Golden Mile Complex was of the same view. She declined to give her name but said she bought her provision shop unit in the complex's early days for $50,000.\n\n&gt;A long-time owner at Golden Mile Tower, who wished to remain anonymous, purchased two units there for $300,000 in 1978. He hopes to sell them for at least $1 million and go into retirement.\n\n&gt;Owners of ageing properties generally try to sell their units before leases are further shortened. Some said they fear having to pay for additional maintenance, renovation or restoration costs. These structures are usually beset with maintenance issues such as choked toilets, malfunctioning lifts and pest infestations.\n\n&gt;Dr Yeo said many of these structures do not have enough time to evolve to a \"heritage age\" before they are torn down.\n\n&gt;Experts have called for a re-look at how these post-independence structures can be conserved appropriately while incentivising developers with more favourable duties.\n\n&gt;Mr Nicholas Mak, executive director of property consultancy SLP International, said that given the large land parcels in question, the developer who buys it is likely to be a major one with \"deep pockets\". It could also be a a consortium of large and medium-sized developers.\n\n&gt;Mr Mak added: \"The easiest way is to bulldoze the buildings and rebuild them.\"\n\n&gt;Landscape and architectural photographer Darren Soh said that these circumstances have created a \"perfect storm\" for historical modernist buildings completed in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n&gt;\"A combination of factors - an ageing property with a dropping value combined with maintenance issues and an increased appetite from developers are driving many owners to seriously consider collective sales.\"", "author": "geegeegeegeebaby2", "created_utc": 1520443713, "score": 0.9838}, {"body": "Yay new phone arrived yesterday :3\n\nEdit: Its an oppo r11s!

Ubin boatmen were also roped in to help ferry all the wedding guests to the island.\n\n&gt; One Ubin resident, Ah Kok, even opened up his home for the couple to have their wedding celebrations.\n\n&gt; \u201cSuddenly it seemed the efforts we\u2019ve put in came back to us in kind, and we had just enough experience and knowledge to pull it off.\u201d\n\n&gt; These \u201cefforts [they] put in\u201d refer to the volunteer work that he and his wife have done on the island, together with several other volunteers from various groups.\n\n&gt; About a year ago,\u00a0Tan and his then-fiancee started spending their weekends on Pulau Ubin\u00a0helping to protect, promote and sustain the Ubin way of life.\n\n&gt; They would create and organise programmes for the residents and visitors, and design activities for people to appreciate life on Ubin.\n\n&gt; The reason? Because the place simply felt like home.\n\n&gt; \u00a0\u201cHearing and seeing the residents\u2019 way of life and neighbourliness, I felt I was home again.\u201d\n\n&gt; In his time on Pulau Ubin, Tan told Mothership.sg that he has helped the residents in any way he could, however small \u2013 For instance, he helped the drinks stall grandma brighten up her fading shop signs and invited young volunteers to clean up a Ubin resident\u2019s house.\n\n&gt; Other than organising programmes for them, the couple also got to know the Ubinites\u2019 stories and do portraits of them.\n\n&gt; Given how strongly he feels for the community, it seemed only natural for him to hold his wedding on Pulau Ubin, and even more natural for them to involve the Ubinites as well:\n\n&gt; \u201cJodi and I would be working with people we knew, kampung style, sharing the joy of hosting this day of our lives, giving everyone a really special day to remember too! \u2026Financially, it also made much more sense to us to hold it on Ubin, since we\u2019ve tended to give most our lives to helping others and had little left to spare.\u201d\n\n&gt; In Singapore\u2019s fast-paced and stressful city life, the sheer volume of sights, sounds and information often result in tensions.\n\n&gt; Tan hopes that he can serve as a reminder\u00a0that kampung life, where humans live harmoniously with nature as well as each other, is well within our reach:\n\n&gt; \u201cAt the end of it all, Jodi and I just hope that Singaporeans can see what it is to live harmoniously with one another, right next to nature, and that it isn\u2019t out of their reach at all\u2026What I hope is that people find a more meaningful way for spending their time and efforts\u2026and get back to the best way to breathe, give, and live, back to the kampung way of life.\u201d\n\n&gt; And more importantly, Ubin\u2019s heritage is not something to be taken for granted or turned into a profit-spinning fad:\n\n&gt; \u201cBut what\u2019s really important is that no-one takes this state of being for granted, or tries to buy out this sense of heritage.

It was a rhetorical question for you to think (for once) about how not every piece of data truly represents what it seems to represent. If I really have to break it down for you, what I meant was whether the position of Singapore on that list (being a 7th place ofc) clearly reflects the level of crime in Singapore. Does having this high placement on a list not representative of crime rates in a country reflect the state of crime in Singapore? Sure, you could draw some links.

When youre in JC its not just about the content. You need to go way more in depth than O levels. You need to have the discipline to study for, my case, 14 hours a day for 5 months everyday if you want to get all As.

Within 2 years I had to learn enough content to aptly criticise Trump's protectionist policies, understand the socio-economic problems of marginalised groups in Singapore, trace the independence and development of Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand, and the rest of SEA, as well as learn calculus that is usually taught in Y1 uni in other parts of the world.\n\nAnd why only A Levels? Any Poly or ITE student would tell you how much he/she learnt during their tertiary years. Because that diploma isnt just about the content. Its about the years learning the soft skills, experiencing life, gaining better understanding. Those valuable years are not just about content. When you learn these things, you use many other soft skills along the way.\n\nOf course all these are not necessary for administrative jobs. But it sure does make a difference working with them.

Don't you think there might some other reasons why Russians do support Putin?\n\nThere are indeed valid reasons why Putin still receives a notable amount of support from the Russian population, despite the fact that over his decade in power, he has done little to diversify the economy and improve the general state of welfare of Russians in the country. Instead, he has focused simply on milking the oil cash cow, enriching himself and his cronies at the same time. Corruption is rampant in Russia, yet there is no viable opposition to Putin - not just because he snuffs out every insurgent flame that arises - but also because for the younger Russians, the only leader they've ever known is Putin, and for the older Russians, Putin is the only leader they can remember with reasonable clarity. This is a significant factor into his continuing popularity despite the weakening economy and equally weak social welfare.\n\nThere is also another factor that can be considered when looking at the reason behind Putin's popular support (I use the word popular loosely), and that's Russia's aggressive, nationalistic and militaristic foreign policy. It is a tried-and-tested method of consolidating domestic support (you don't have to look very far back in history to find examples, Mussolini is one such figure that did the same, although with much less success). After the Cold War, Russian humiliation was real, and much of Putin's popularity is actually built on him making Russia great again (Trump is really a copycat-slash-puppet). The annexation of Crimea and the recent poisoning of Skripal in the UK are two such examples. Such aggressive manoeuvres are easily twisted by the government into acts of sovereign triumph, that Russia is asserting itself as a major power on the world stage. Surely you'd want your country to be respected (and maybe even feared) on the world stage, and for some people, this clouds their political views, so obviously you'd want to keep in power the man that is making your country great again, so to speak.\n\n&gt;Isn't it the case almost everywhere? How many times I've heard this about state owned media in Singapore?\n\nState-owned media in Singapore, I'd argue, has absolutely **nothing** on what the Russians are doing. They've been at this far longer than we have, and have a much more complex mechanism in place to promote Putin's agenda. Singapore literally wishes we could be them. Just go on Youtube and search up Russian documentaries, you'll find that several of them are from RT (formerly Russia Today), which is government-owned. They broadcast in several languages and propagate their news not just domestically but internationally as well. It really is such a massive, organised machine that the last thing you can say is that it's ineffective. Also you must note that geographically, Russia is massive, it spans something like 10-11 timezones and you won't be able to receive the same variety of news coverage that we do everywhere there; in many places, RT is their main source of news.

The breakdowns on the London Underground is pretty much a way of life, yet in Singapore breakdowns are a cause for mass hysteria.\n\nAs others have pointed out, countries like Japan and Taiwan have train systems that are far better than ours, but while we're on the topic of infrastructure i would say that considering our roads and bus routes we're not that far off overall.\n\nOther types of infrastructure: our malls are great, especially for our climate. Public housing is getting boring. Most Singaporeans stay in public housing (HDBs), and we buy the flat instead of renting it like most of the world do. However, in order for flats to remain affordable, all of the apartments have taken on the same shape, size, design, and fittings, regardless of where on the island you stay. Even condominiums are starting to have the same pattern. It's all about efficiency, and it works, but it does get boring. Just a personal gripe.\n\nPublic spaces are clean because of the cleaners we hire, and the looming threat of a fine if we littered wherever we liked.

Our Asian neighbours used to rely on us for relations with the West. Now that they're becoming major powers in their own right, our relevance can become diminished. If my memory serves me right, Malaysia is building a port larger than ours, which can eventually take some of our business away. China is investing in reconnecting its Silk Road, which when it's done, our port will lose much of its relevance.\n\nSingapore's current approach seems to be to throw money at whatever's the latest trend - previously it was biotechnology, recently it's computer science and coding. I'm not sure if it's the right way forward because there doesn't seem to be an overarching main plan for the future.\n\nSingaporeans care about our country and want it to always prosper. Our history of hardship isn't as far behind us as it is for US. Stories of tough times and living through the Japanese Occupation are still within the minds of our parents' or grandparents' generations, so we still have some of their survival mentality.

The Flemish trader Jacques de Coutre, who had passed through Singapore waters several times in the late 1500s and early 1600s, called Singapore Isla de la Sabandaria Vieja (Island of the Old Sabandaria) after the presence of the Singapore shahbandar (port master).\n\nAdditional names included Insel Gubernador (Governor's Island) after the Governor's Strait, the European name for the main Singapore Strait between 1616 and 1819. This was used by Gottfried von Laimbeckhoven, an Austrian Jesuit who later became the Bishop of Nanjing, when he recorded his sea voyage past the island in 1738.\n\nFor most of recorded history, Singapore was certainly appreciated as a strategic location, both militarily and commercially.\n\nAsian and European geographical materials from the period 1500-1800 - and arguably before - saw Singapore as marking an area of transition between the Bay of Bengal and the Strait of Malacca in the west and the South China Sea in the east. Similarly, some Arab and Portuguese authors of the pre-modern period treat Singapore as a gate or gateway.\n\nThe local rulers and the early European colonial powers knew that anyone who controlled the waters of the Singapore Strait would gain a grip on passing maritime trade.\n\nBecause of Singapore's strategic location, early European powers active in the Straits region sought to gain a grip on the flow of seaborne trade in these waters to disrupt and damage the commercial networks of their European competitors.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company, or VOC, routinely deployed vessels in the early 1600s at certain nodal points in the Singapore Strait.\n\nOne squadron was assigned to cruise the eastern coast of Singapore and the Johor River estuary, while another patrolled the waters off the northern coast of the Karimun islands. From these two nodal points, it was possible to monitor all traffic sailing through the Singapore and southern Malacca straits as well as their main tributaries: the Kundur, Durian, Sugi, Jombol, Riau and Tebrau straits.\n\nIn addition to patrolling nodal points along the Karimun-Singapore-Pedra Branca axis, a number of proposals were also put forward to construct fortifications in and around Singapore, although none came to fruition before 1800. The Dutch were known to have been planning in the early 1600s for a fort at the north-western tip of present-day Sentosa - at the same location where Fort Siloso was built by the British much later. Additional Dutch proposals drawn up around 1614 included a possible fortification along the eastern coast of Singapore.\n\nOne of the most detailed and interesting proposals is found in a petition drafted by de Coutre, dating from the mid-1620s. In this document, he advised the King of Spain (concurrently of Portugal) to construct a main fortification at the north-western tip of today's Sentosa. A second structure was suggested for the eastern coast of Singapore, and a third for an unspecified islet located off Pulau Tekong Besar. From the latter, it would have been possible to observe shipping entering and leaving the Johor River as well as the Tebrau Strait.\n\nAll these proposals by the Dutch or Spanish were halted either because of high overhead costs, more urgent priorities or opposition from the Johor ruler.\n\nCommercially, at least two centuries before Raffles arrived on the scene, Singapore was already appreciated for its fine port and for its commercial potential as a colonial settlement. De Coutre considered the port of Singapore as \"one of the best that serves the Indies\", and proceeded to recommend that the Spanish monarch found a colonial emporium here.\n\nAbraham Couperus, who had been the last Dutch governor of Melaka until 1795, had also recommended to his superior, Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels, in 1809 that the Dutch should consider founding a new colony, to be built up from ground zero, after the Anglo-French Wars.\n\nCouperus singled out two locations he thought would prove suitable: the island of Belitung (Billiton) and Singapore, or at least a location at the tip of the peninsula. Interestingly, Raffles shortly thereafter acquired both places, arranging for the acquisition of Bangka and Belitung from Palembang in 1812, and Singapore in 1819.\n\nWhat does this all amount to? Singapore was most certainly not a lost and forgotten place in 1819, or indeed in the centuries before that. It was recognised for its locational value, and had been singled out in proposals for both fortification and colonisation.\n\nWith the perspective of deep time, the story of Raffles' discovery of Singapore should be seen less as a discovery, but as the most recent in a series of visions for the island.\n\n\u2022 Peter Borschberg is an associate professor with the history department of the National University of Singapore.", "author": "Jammy_buttons", "created_utc": 1522891509, "score": 0.9795}, {"body": "There is : http://asdsingapore.com/wp/rates-charges/\n\n\nAlthough there is a 2 week advanced notice to contend with.", "author": "dreadiplomat110", "created_utc": 1522905028, "score": 0.296}, {"body": "Vans with champion white socks then cuff my jeans super high to show off.

He said 'Let Pritam run the show'.\"\n\n&gt;Mr Singh, 41, currently assistant secretary-general of the party, is widely tipped to be the favourite to be its next leader, but fellow Aljunied MP Chen, 57, had been seen as a possible contender.\n\n&gt;In 2016, Mr Chen mounted a surprise bid against Mr Low, 61, making history as the first and only challenger to Mr Low for the party chief role since he took charge in 2001.\n\n&gt;Mr Chen lost with 45 votes to Mr Low's 61. The votes were cast by the party's cadres.\n\n&gt;The development upended the assumption that Mr Low enjoyed near-unanimous support from WP cadres. Mr Chen said he wanted to give them \"an opportunity to exercise our democratic rights\".\n\n&gt;When asked by The Straits Times this week if he would contest this time round, Mr Chen replied cryptically via e-mail: \"I agree with many things that have been said in public about our upcoming elections.\n\n&gt;\"Even so, the elections are ultimately a matter for our party members - I look forward respectfully to our making a decision soon, and in good time.\"\n\n&gt;He did not specify what were the public statements he referred to. But in the wake of Mr Low's announcement last November that he would be stepping down, many fellow WP MPs voiced support for Mr Singh to be his successor.\n\n&gt;But before the recent meeting, Mr Chen's supporters were planning to nominate him for the top job again, said those interviewed. This faction of cadres, mainly veterans who joined when the late J.B. Jeyaretnam helmed the party from 1971 to 2001, have been unhappy with Mr Low for purportedly sidelining them in favour of fielding younger, more educated members as election candidates. They also felt they were not consulted on matters such as the election manifesto.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, Mr Chen was viewed as a consultative member of WP leadership who communicated frequently with the older cadres.\n\n&gt;On March 24, he met them at a McDonalds' outlet in Bendemeer at their invitation. For two hours, he addressed their questions including on his intentions on Sunday.\n\n&gt;Cadres interviewed said those present have come to terms with his decision. \"With Low stepping down, Pritam could hopefully be the one to start things anew. We shall see in a year or two,\" said one, adding Mr Singh had also reached out to older cadres like him to try to understand the group's concerns.\n\n&gt;Another cadre agreed that its rank-and-file members now felt \"it is better to give Pritam a chance\".\n\n&gt;A third cadre said another factor - which boils down to simple arithmetic - is at play. This faction is dwindling, due to deaths and switches in allegiance. Meanwhile, some 30 new cadres were brought in into the party recently.\n\n&gt;He said: \"Mr Chen knows himself that he has no chance. If he decides to run, we will still support him, but Pritam is still the favourite to win.\"\n\n&gt;But the consensus reached at the meeting may not necessarily hold on Sunday.\n\n&gt;The Straits Times reached out to other members of the group. Some said there was no such gathering and declined to comment.\n\n&gt;When contacted, Mr Chen disputed the cadres' accounts, only saying: \"This is inaccurate\". He did not say what the inaccuracies were.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, there is still a possibility that someone outside the group might decide to put up Mr Chen's name, said the cadres.", "author": "geegeegeegeebaby2", "created_utc": 1523031087, "score": 0.9979}, {"body": "Let Pritam take over.

Well, it depends on what you think. I'm doing well for myself, but know also that it'll be hard for me to move further up.

It was also the first one under a new party leader in 17 years, after Mr Pritam Singh was elected unopposed as WP secretary-general. Ms Sylvia Lim was re-elected as party chairman.\n\n&gt; In a reshuffle of posts, Mr Gerald Giam will take over as treasurer from Non-Constituency MP Dennis Tan from May 15.\n\n&gt; Mr Tan succeeds Hougang MP Png Eng Huat as organising secretary, with fellow NCMP Daniel Goh assuming the same post. New CEC member Terence Tan was named deputy organising secretary.\n\n&gt; Mr Leon Perera replaces Mr Giam as president of WP&amp;apos;s Youth Wing, and retains his post as deputy chair of WP&amp;apos;s media team. Dr Goh retains his post as chair of the media team, Aljunied GRC MP Faisal Manap is still party vice-chairman, while Ms Lee Li Lian remains deputy treasurer.\n\n&gt; Besides Mr Low, there are four other committee members who round up the 14-member CEC - Mr Png Eng Huat, Mr Chen Show Mao, Mr Firuz Khan and Dr John Yam.\n\n&gt; This means three of the party&amp;apos;s six elected MPs - Mr Low, Mr Png and Mr Chen - are not holding any posts in the CEC.\n\n&gt; WP cadre Henry Ho said the changes indicate that newer CEC members like Dr Goh, Mr Giam, Mr Tan and Mr Perera will play a \"busier role\", while older members take a back seat.\n\n&gt; As for Mr Low, former deputy organising secretary Kenneth Foo Seck Guan said the WP veteran can still provide guidance to the rest of the team as \"his years of experience are invaluable\".\n\n&gt; He added: \"To me, the CEC has kept two things in mind: party renewal, and giving a chance to members they have identified to be strong in a certain role.\"\n\n&gt; Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Singh declined to share what was discussed, or comment on other questions about the party, including his goals and the role Mr Low will play. He was flanked by the new office-bearers, while Mr Low and other committee members were notably absent.\n\n&gt; Mr Singh said the next few months will be busy, as he meets WP members to get their views on moving forward.\n\n&gt; It will be up to members to raise any issues on their minds, he said, adding: \"I don&amp;apos;t want to drive the conversation in a particular way.\"\n\n&gt; Mr Singh also deflected a question on a Facebook post by Mr Chen, who hoped for \"more forward-looking progressive leadership\" that is \"more open to new ideas, people and ways of doing things\".\n\n&gt; He said: \"It&amp;apos;s not fair for me to put words into (Mr Chen&amp;apos;s) mouth, better for you to interview him.\"\n\n&gt; Mr Chen had repeatedly declined to comment on his post.\n\n&gt; After his election on Sunday, Mr Singh had said that he wants the party to move forward as a team and that \"the process will be quite consultative\".\n\n&gt; Party cadres welcomed their new chief&amp;apos;s consultative approach to leadership. Mr Mohamed Fairoz Shariff, a former CEC member, said: \"Mr Low also had an open-door policy, though his years of experience meant it is not as critical for him to hear from the rank-and-file members.

As promised, I\u2019m gonna write about my experience with SMRT work culture. I\u2019m currently working at SMRT as a Station Manager (SM) and for privacy/security/work reasons, I would not go into technical details of work and try as much as possible to anonymise the things. I am not going to send proof because this is the only livelihood I have and I don\u2019t want to lose job just because I talk bad about the organization on reddit. I swear, my direct supervisor maybe on reddit and he not really on good terms with me. Also, apologise in advance for bad English, I\u2019m not good with English since young (poly graduate). Anyway, I see that the SMRT problem has been getting worse ever since the time when we had the \u201ccable tie\u201d problem. It seems to be getting worse, but like what they always say: \u201cWe are working on it\u201d. No, seriously, we are working on it, if only the people here aren\u2019t that all lazy and complacent. People always say to me: Why SMRT don\u2019t have SOP? Why they don\u2019t tell the SM what to do at station if train breakdown? Actually, we have SOP. The SOP is quite long and covers almost all situation, even those that you have never experience before. You know why people don\u2019t follow or cut corners on SOP? Because it\u2019s boring and repetitive. Our station staff get lazy. Why must check XYZ every hour? Check if this thing locked? No need lah, won\u2019t happen one. Limpeh work for 25 years NEVER happen, don\u2019t worry! At least according to one of my colleagues. Some of them have worked for 30 years in the company and yet, they are still slacking off. Yes, 30 years. Old old birds, from the time where we got wear epaulets on grey shirt. You might be thinking: Okay lah, people get bored with repetitive stuff. Men would know from NS, it gets boring after the 200th time you go patrol the camp. But this is getting out of hand. Some of my colleagues, who working in station, go sleep for like a few hours every shift. Sleep, play games or even just lepak. Some are still hardworking, even though they sleep, but some really cmi. One station the aircon went out, the SM did not deploy fans, because want to sleep. Also, other stations had things where the station staff go handle \u201csuspicious articles\u201d like as if not suspicious. What if that thing explode? I don\u2019t want to imagine. Sometimes it even gets criminal. You know why LTA suddenly got idea to go cashless by 2020? It\u2019s not smart nation, that is just excuse for covering up something worse. Because station staff always \u201cborrow\u201d money from the PSC cash drawer to buy lunch/dinner/groceries and then they either: lie on the cash report or they blame other staff for the shortage. That is what I suspect is true reason and there was this incident in the news where the Tanah Merah SM stole $20k from the PSC. Another thing is I heard got staff who always like to scold passengers if they blur or if they scold at them. I know we are not customer service kind of training, but that is bad customer service. The staff not scared of being fired? They are not scared. Because every time got problem, CEO and top management, those university educated people, get the blame. They all attend the conferences and kena sai from public. We all are the ones who did it, but we never kena, only cut bonus or kena \u201cstrongly worded\u201d email. Yes, maybe the pump incident they got, because that is almost criminal. But most of the time, our uncle Desmond and Khaw take the blame. We all don\u2019t. Sometimes like ironic because the passengers give gifts to staff who I know are lazy. They all also cannot fire because: we all collude with our supervisors, who is usually someone we know who got promoted or they have no proof one. If got proof also, one of the colleagues say he gonna post on social media and shame SMRT and their million dollar management for firing someone who is working very hard to feed his family, even though I know he always cut corners and slack off. You know what? Singaporeans will accept the story, because blue collar worker kena fired by men in white. Oppo figures also repost, because can use for politics and shame government. Win win right? But commuters never win, the lazy staff will get the job back through pressure by public. What can outside people do? Actually, I also don\u2019t know. I want to say should follow Donald Trump (I don\u2019t support him) slogan: \u201cDrain the swamp\u201d. The SMRT is just basically a swamp filled with leeches. Top to bottom, all of them like your NSmen: lazy, chao keng, siam and arrow people. People tell me they should replace Desmond with HK/JP/don\u2019t know what CEO. But for what? Some colleagues even got the cheek to say: \u201cbetter lah, cos japan ceo always take blame and they cut salary. Shiok, still can enjoy bonus.\u201d and that cos Japan companies like to shame workers by removing responsibilities: \u201cshiok ah. Don\u2019t need to do work still get paid\u201d. How to fix liddat? You need to remove this people, they already got the mindset of not doing work.\nI heard SMRT is hiring FT from nearby countries because they not enough local talent who want to join MRT especially with the news. I actually support that idea, because they all are at least hard working and if they don\u2019t do work, they have to leave Singapore. My colleagues all jealous when the FT gets award by SMRT, but my personal experience is, at least they do their work and they don\u2019t go against everyone. I not saying that I want FT to work, but it\u2019s actually better for the train system. I finish ranting already, fed up but I like trains and the work.

The mid-2015 census reports that about 74.1% of residents were of Chinese descent, 13.4% of Malay descent, 9.2% of Indian descent, and 3.3% of other (including Eurasian) descent.\n\n&gt;&gt;Singapore has seen many race riots as well as opposition from its two Malay Neighbors over racist remarks of some Parliament members towards Muslim Malay and even Indians.\n\n&gt;&gt;By saying that this environment is \u2018better\u2019 than the U.S. I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t know much about Singapore.

BUT, I can share some stuff to do in Londo, Paris, and some tips.\n\nFor London, transportation is decent and overall, good. Train lines are easy to understand and you can buy an oyster card at any self topup machine. Just be prepared for it to be more expensive than singapore (singapore's mrt is very cheap relative to the West). Also, **use the crossrail if coming from Heathrow**. It currently isn't finished but it's gonna make things easier especially since you're traveling alone (officially called the Elizabeth line). For accommodation, London is expensive, so be sure to budget for that.  \n\nMy recommendation in London is the IWM, British museum (but VERY crowded, come in the morning. Go straight to the mummies), Camden town, Westminster Abbey (highly recommend, not many tourists visit here. You can also visit netwon, Darwin and raffles. But you can't take photos since it's a church), and Churchill's bunker. DO NOT go to Buckingham palace because it's always crowded to fuck and the changing of the guards isn't that exciting (the police horses were more interesting). If you want, you can take the national rail to visit Oxford/Cambridge etc. \n\nFor food in London, Camden town is amazing. But if in a pinch, borough market near elephant and Castle is nice. In London, try not to stay out at night and avoid council neighborhoods. Knife and acid crime is on the rise, just don't be stupid and use common sense. You should be be ok. Don't dress as tourist.\n\nFrom London, you can take Eurostar to go to Paris, but I don't recommend unless you really like art and culture. I personally stayed a week here and felt it was not enough while my friend got bored after two days. \n\nWhen you exit the train station at Paris (Du nord) be VERY careful of pickpockets. Just exit, buy metro tickets and be on your way. Don't dress and act like a tourist or you will Kenna tio mark. \n\nObvious stuff to do is lourve, effiel tower, arc de triumph, la d\u00e9fense, Notre dame, and musee de orsay.  For the lourve, it took two days for me to fully appreciate it. Don't just focus on the mona Lisa like a typical tourist. There's the wedding of cana, Napoleon on horseback, winged victory of samothrace, venus de Milo, Egyptian sphinx, and an Easter island monolith. Get the audio guide, it's 100% worth it. (It's an old PSP).\n\nFor food, go to Paris Les helles. If you want breakfast, go to Bastille market for the fresh oysters (or snails with pigeon if you prefer). From there on, it's up to you to craft your journey in mainland Europe. You may want to go to the French Alps.\n\nNow, there's a small tip. If you can, take SAS or Norwegian air to Troms\u00f8. It's a really beautiful place where reality just seems to stop. There's the northern lights, ice cold Arctic weather, reindeer meat, fjords, whales, and the cable car.  Highly recommend, especially the northern light tours. I spent 1k on private tours and felt I should have spent more. Time it right, and you'll get the most wonderful thing you will ever lay eyes upon. \n\nAs for cost, i would budget 3.5k for maybe 3 weeks plus airfare. Stay in cheap hotels and eat street food.

The article appeared in The Straits Times of Dec 23, 1997.\n\nOf late, there has been several high-profile cases involving bribery and embezzlement, attracting commentary both in the media and outside. One recurrent theme is that the penalties for corruption and criminal breach of trust are insufficient.\n\nThis is not quite accurate. The problem is not that the penalties are too low; it is that the available tools have not been utilised fully.\n\nIn the 1997 case, Keppel Corporation faced 17 charges of bribery. A total of $8.53 million was paid to the repair and technical manager of a British subsidiary of Exxon Corporation over a period of more than three years. In return for the payments, Keppel got contracts to maintain and repair 17 of Exxon's tankers. The statement of facts tendered to the court revealed that this had been done with the knowledge and approval of senior Keppel executives, including some directors.\n\nThe prosecution chose to proceed with only three of the charges. Keppel pleaded guilty, which meant that it admitted the statement of facts without qualification. The district judge fined Keppel the maximum $100,000 on each of the charges, a total of $300,000. And there, the matter ended.\n\nWorkers' Party MP J. B. Jeyaretnam asked in Parliament on Feb 27, 1998, whether action would be taken against any of the directors of Keppel. The then Minister of State for Law, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, stated that the Public Prosecutor had decided that \"the company should be prosecuted, not the employees who gave the bribes. He did so after considering all the facts of the case, including the fact that they did not act for their own personal gain\".\n\nDespite being pressed, the Minister of State would not say why the directors were not prosecuted, reiterating the Public Prosecutor's stated view that they did not act for their personal gain.\n\nBut this reasoning also raises questions.\n\nWhy do employees of a company bribe others to get business? It is true that they may not benefit directly (unlike where they receive bribes), but altruism is not a motive impelling corporate employees to give bribes in return for business.\n\nEmployees have KPIs (key performance indicators) to meet. More business translates into bigger profits for the company (or at least smaller losses). This in turn leads to enhanced bonuses and improved promotion prospects. For the directors, there is also the prestige associated with leading a \"successful\" company. When was the last time the CEO of a loss-making company won an industry accolade or got interviewed in the press?\n\nThere was no indication in the statement of facts of how much profit Keppel made from giving $8.53 million in bribes. From a purely commercial point of view, if the value of the business obtained from paying a bribe exceeds the penalty, it makes sense to continue bribing. Any fine is just set off against the profits, for a net gain.\n\nBut does this prove the inadequacy of the penalties? Not quite.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor chose for whatever reason to proceed with only three out of 17 charges. If all 17 charges had been pressed, the maximum fine would have been $1.7 million, a much more painful hit.\n\nBut prosecuting the company alone is not the answer, no matter how big the fine.\nSENTENCING PRINCIPLES\n\nA digression is necessary to understand the rationale for imposing sentences.\n\nConventionally, there are four principles guiding sentencing: retribution, deterrence, protection of the public and rehabilitation.\n\nThe principle of protection of the public underlies sentences like imprisonment, disqualification from driving, and the ultimate penalty, capital punishment. The offender is removed as a public menace.\n\nThis principle has no application to companies. A company cannot be jailed or sentenced to death. Winding it up hurts only the creditors, employees and shareholders.\n\nRehabilitative sentences are imposed mostly on young offenders, to give them a chance to turn their lives around. Thus, instead of sentencing a young person to jail (where he or she may learn worse things), probation or community service may be imposed. Again, this does not apply to companies.\n\nThis leaves retribution, deterrence and one further consideration, denunciation.\n\nRetribution in law is not used in the sense of vengeance or reprisal. It means that there has to be some punishment for breaking the law. Most people have an instinctive sense that there have to be consequences for wrongdoing. Let a criminal off (or punish him too lightly) and there will be howls of protest (virtual as well as actual).\n\nDenunciation is again an instinctive matter. The sentence imposed by a court sends a signal as to how seriously a society views a crime. If a politician authorises bribery in order to get elected or embezzles funds from state companies, what signal is sent if the court pronounces a suspended sentence? If a rapist is let off with only a fine, what does that say about that society's attitude towards violence against women?\n\nIn Singapore, corruption - whether in the form of bribery or criminal breach of trust - is considered to be a cardinal sin. Sentences have to reflect that.\n\nFinally, deterrence. Any parent will instinctively understand this. It is necessary in some cases to impose punishment so that the offender will not repeat the offence - specific deterrence. Often, the severity of the sentence deters others from committing such offences - general deterrence.\n\nThe most notorious example happened when the Japanese took Singapore in February 1942. Looters were summarily decapitated. For the rest of the occupation, it was said that people could leave their doors unlocked without fear of being robbed. The deterrent effect of seeing the looters' heads displayed in public kept the baser instincts of potential criminals in check.\n\nThe problem with sentencing companies is that the normal principles aren't always appropriate. Retribution and denunciation demand that a company should face consequences for paying bribes in order to get business. It would make a complete mockery of our purported zero-tolerance approach to corruption if such a company were allowed to get away with it.\n\nBut a low fine hardly suffices. Piddling fines paid in return for potentially millions in business can be written off against the profits generated from the bribes.\n\nHowever, a fine in the billions can also be unjust. It hits the wrong people. Substantial fines paid by companies reduce profits, which affects the bonuses of employees who have absolutely nothing to do with the corruption. In some cases, dividends to shareholders may have to be withheld. In an extreme case, a billion-dollar fine could push a company into insolvency, hitting the unsecured creditors. Often the promotions given and bonuses paid in the past to the people responsible for the bribery are not clawed back, so the pain is felt by the innocent, not the guilty.\n\nThe same applies even more forcefully to the principle of deterrence.\n\nCompanies cannot be deterred from bad behaviour. A company cannot think for itself. It has no personal morality or conscience. Fines are merely written off as a cost of business. Unscrupulous managers and directors may calculate that the risk of bribery is worth taking, since even if the company is caught, the potential fine is outweighed by the profits to be gained. More profit equals bigger bonuses and quicker promotion. The risk-reward balance comes down on the side of bribery.\nPUNISHING THE PEOPLE INVOLVED\n\nIt is therefore necessary for the sake of deterrence - specific and general - that the humans responsible for corruption should be prosecuted as well.\n\nThis happened in the case of Singapore Technologies Marine (ST Marine), a subsidiary of the government-linked Singapore Technologies Engineering.\n\nAs in the Keppel case, ST Marine paid cash \"commissions\" to customers in return for business. Several senior executives were prosecuted for various offences, including bribery, falsification of company records and breach of directors' duties.\n\nThe former CEO and president of ST Marine pleaded guilty in August 2016 and got 10 months' jail as well as a $100,000 fine.\n\nAccording to the statement of facts (which he admitted), at least $24.9 million had been paid out in bribes between 2000 and 2011. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau's investigations showed that based on ST Marine's records, this practice stretched back to at least 1996, which raises tantalising questions about how far and deep the cancer had metastasised within the group.\n\nBesides the former CEO, four other senior executives also were sentenced to jail terms of four to six months, on top of fines ranging from $80,000 to $100,000. Two other senior executives were fined $210,000 and $300,000 respectively for falsification of accounts to hide the bribes, but avoided jail time. One other executive director pleaded guilty to lack of reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as director - he received a 14-day short detention order.\n\nIn addition, those who were convicted of offences involving fraud or dishonesty would be disqualified under the Companies Act from managing or being directors of companies for five years. Those implicated in the bribery would be caught by this disqualification. This is an example of the protection of the public principle in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "author": "Jammy_buttons", "created_utc": 1525088095, "score": -0.9982}, {"body": "What if you rephrase the question to: for the same job, would you pay an employee on a WP the same amount as a Singapore PR / citizen?

Everyone seems to be putting down what this church is doing, but in actual fact there\u2019s tons of good things that this church is doing that nobody is talking about.\nI know the whole church/christianity atmosphere in SG now is rather shaky due to all the recent scandals, but hey, people are flawed, and they make mistakes. Christianity is not based off a person and never was, there will be numerous Christians that make mistakes and stir up a mess but that doesn\u2019t affect how I see God at all, who is unchanging.\nFirstly, I\u2019m not an expert on Christianity nor am I an expert \u201cchurch-analyst\u201d. If my theology/argument/logic is wrong, please feel free to correct me.\nSimilarly, in no way do I intend to offend anyone here. This is just my opinion, but I really hope that OP will read this and share his views too.\n\n\nTo start off, It seems like you already came into church with a mind filled with doubt ready to criticise and find fault already. *Why?*\nI hope you don\u2019t try to impose your Catholic beliefs on Christianity and on this church, because we operate rather differently.\n\nThis church is doing good, and probably much more than others. You've heard the testimonies.\nI don\u2019t agree 100% with the methods that the church use sometimes, but I agree with the heart behind the things they do. The good severely outweighs the bad.\n\nI still believe in this church. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of them misappropriating any funds or engaging in anything shady. In fact, every year they educate the members on how their funds are being used in a service, including the subsidiaries like Sentinel Tech etc\u2026\n\nHonestly, what this church is doing is not easy to comprehend, it took me years. But I\u2019m glad I stayed through because I started to see that this church was really carrying out God\u2019s mission and helping others.\n\nYeah I know in the past the way they evangelised was more outright and it can come off as weird/intimidating and I totally understand, but I believe now they\u2019ve realised how weird it could be so they don\u2019t really do it that way anymore.\nBut hey, don\u2019t take one members\u2019 evangelism experience to judge the church. There are many Christians out there that sincerely love their friends and simply just want to have their friends attend church to listen to what Christianity has to offer.\n\n\n**The Devil\u2019s Bargain:**\nTo me, it was a solid sermon that is much needed in today\u2019s Christianity. It is sound doctrine from the Bible, made relevant to today\u2019s world. Of course, when a message is comforting and simply talking about God\u2019s grace and love, nobody would have a problem with it. But when occasionally a stronger sermon comes along, people rebuke it because most of the times, they feel uncomfortable, foreign\u2026 as it challenges them to think/act differently, and people generally don\u2019t like to change.\nSimilarly, when Jesus was blessing people and healing, everyone loved Him. But when He taught us to reflect and confront our situations, to give up this bad habit or that, many left because they wanted to stay in their own comfort zone.\n\nI\u2019ve heard many different responses from new people that were positive, even Christians who have attended other churches.\nI\u2019m just wondering, why is it so different for you then? Did you really understand what the heart behind the message was? or did it simply sparked off the already negative and dismissive pre-conceptions in your mind.\nNot to be harsh but, do you even understand what Christianity is about? Because it was a really good message.\n\n*On radical Christianity...*\nI believe you have a misconception about \u201cradical\u201d Christianity. It is most definitely not the KKK, that is totally absurd and in the first place doesn\u2019t even align with what the Bible teaches. It is obviously not about violence...\n\nChristianity is about being more like Jesus in our character. The Church here is teaching and equipping us to be active Christians, not just passive Christians that go about living life as if the world still revolves around them. Radical Christianity means going out to do something, to change the world through Jesus. Not by violence definitely. It is saying that \u201cInstead of going after the trivial pursuits in life, why not do something that can positively impact the world/others?\u201d Show that you\u2019re a Christian through your acts and behaviours. It starts out with the little things in our everyday lives: Be more grateful and appreciative of people around you - that\u2019s radical. Let go of bitterness and forgive others - that\u2019s radical.\nCan you see the image here? Christianity is so much more than just going to church every sunday. And honestly, what\u2019s the point of going to church every sunday if you walk out the same person as you walked in?\n\nIf you read about how Jesus lived, that\u2019s the benchmark for radical Christianity. It culminated in Him giving up His life on the cross for others, even when He was innocent. To me, that\u2019s radical Christianity.\nPastors are definitely not asking people to suddenly give up everything and serve God forever, they are simply letting us know what Jesus would have wanted us to do, by giving a vision, a direction that we can have in view. Many people do not know what to do after they become a Christian.\n\nThus, I see it that this church is really trying its best to act as how the Bible would want us to, and that always comes with much persecutions and tribulations. As you would read in the Bible, those who are passionate for God or anything in fact always face opposition. If you remain a nonchalant lukewarm person, no one\u2019s gonna be bothered by you because you aren\u2019t doing anything substantial.\nThis church is definitely not a cult.\n\n\n**Why do they thank Pastors?**\nIn my first year or so, I really struggled to understand why the church operated this way\u2026 the \u2018wow\u2019s and \u2018amen\u2019s, the way they thanked the pastors. I understand sometimes it may seem over the top, but maybe you should see it from a different perspective.\nIt really didn\u2019t make sense to me at first, but it started to when I first-hand heard from my friends about what Pastors have done for them individually, and there are many stories, most of which aren\u2019t shared on stage. It is through these that slowly I started to understand why the people were so grateful for their pastors.\n\nWhy they\u2019re thankful is simple. It\u2019s about teaching honour.\nTake a look at Hebrews 13:17 and 1 Timothy 5:17-18.\nI would rather see the young people honouring the leaders in church and setting them as their role models, than see them going crazy worshipping hollywood celebrities who most of the times aren\u2019t good role models at all.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between honour and worship. Honour your leaders, but only worship God. These people here really deeply honour Pastors. And after attending for a few years, I can understand why.\nIf you have heard about the church\u2019s history, you would know that this church was built from scratch by both Pastors. It wasn\u2019t handed down to them by a previous pastor in a comfortable state nor were they financially capable to build a church at that point of time. They gave up their comfortable and comfy jobs to start the church.\n\nThey built this church from scratch for 21 years, back when it just started out in a humble HDB flat. And during these 21 years the church faced many setbacks but they still gave their best to lead through all the hardships and that\u2019s why the church grew and can have a beautiful sanctuary for worship today. I\u2019ve seen a portion of what they\u2019ve done and I feel that yes they are indeed worthy of that honour, seriously. Because I don\u2019t think anyone else has really done what they have done for God, and the members.\n\n\n**Tithing:**\nYou said that you\u2019ve already preset a condition in your mind that \u201cIf the pastors ever preached anything about giving money to the church, I\u2019d leave.\u201d\nSounds like you\u2019re setting your own conditions for Christianity, are you God?\nI can see your resentment towards giving, but that does not mean that giving is wrong, in fact the Bible clearly talks about it.\n\nObviously, the main focus of Christianity is not about money, but how we handle money also affects our we live our life as Christians. That\u2019s why God teaches us how to in the Bible. Does money control us or do we control money?\n\nFurthermore, money doesn\u2019t fall from the sky. I understand why this church has tithing and offering. It is encouraged but not enforced, because there's no point giving out of a grudging heart, but still it needs to be taught. I see my tithing and offering as a way of contributing back to the church, firstly because I am thankful for what God and church has done for me, but also because I want to help this church grow, and I know that my giving can be used to help other people / fund mission trips. I\u2019m not gonna freeload off church.\n\nI respect this church for being bold to teach about giving, because many churches are afraid to do so despite it clearly being talked about in the Bible.\n\nI'll carry on in my next comment.", "author": "Pentafaux", "created_utc": 1527189557, "score": 0.9998}, {"body": "Agreed, especially considering that even today he still says things like Operation Lalang were to \"quell racial riots for the good of the country.\" But I don't think it's about Dr M per se, it's about him crossing over to the opposition and defeating BN. \n\nI would think that Dr M sees Najib's rule as penance for what he himself did, that's why he wants to make things better and make amends.

Twenty-two percent of lesbian women in contrast to 1% of heterosexual women reported homosexual molestation.\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11501300\n\nThis report is on childhood molestation, and the percentages reported were molestation **victims**, not predators. Anybody can be molested as a child.\n\n&gt; \"In 2014, gay and bisexual men made up an estimated 2% of the U.S. population, but accounted for 70% of new HIV infections.\" https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.html\n\nThe reason for this can be found [here](https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/fact-sheets/25/81/hiv-and-gay-and-bisexual-men). Just a sad point that gays may contract this *non-sexuality specific* disease compared to people with different sexual preferences.\n\n&gt; \"Since the smoking rate within the LGBT community is roughly double that of the general population, more members of the LGBT community are at greatly increased risk of these deadly diseases, as well as other tobacco-related health threats such as heart attacks and strokes.\" http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/research/lgbt-report.pdf\n\nThe very paper you linked has a section from pages 9-13, more than a fifth of the paper, explaining **why** smoking rates among LGBT communities are high, like the heavy clubbing/bar culture in most LGBT communities, social stigma from a number of stress factors and the tobacco industry placing the LGBT community as an advertising target.\n\n&gt; \"A study to be released next month is offering a rare glimpse inside gay relationships and reveals that monogamy is not a central feature for many.\" http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29sfmetro.html\n\nThe newspaper article here discusses the reasons that homosexuals may not indulge in a monogamous marriage. While, even as a closeted bi, I think a monogamous marriage is best, it's nice to **hear a differing opinion**. While I don't agree with them, it's their way of living, and if they are able to have a stronger relationship that way, *so be it.*\n\n&gt; \"Research also shows that, compared to other men, gay and bisexual men have higher chances of having: \u2022 Major depression, \u2022 Bipolar disorder, and \u2022 Generalized anxiety disorder.\" https://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/mental-health.htm\n\nThis page also, once again, states the *reasons* for such a high risk of mental problems. As the article says, *\"However, ongoing homophobia, stigma (negative and usually unfair beliefs), and discrimination (unfairly treating a person or group of people) can have negative effects on your health.\".* Here, the reasons are put forward, and these issues have to do with the **social climate around LGBT people**, NOT being homosexual itself.\n\n&gt; \"If we only compare levels in union dissolution, divorce risks are considerably higher in same-sex than in opposite-sex marriages.\" (in Norway and Sweden) http://www.uni-koeln.de/wiso-fak/fisoz/conference/abstracts/a_andersson.pdf\n\nOkay, this one doesn't explain any underlying reasons I could find. However, it's explained in [this article](http://www.newnownext.com/why-lesbian-couples-divorce-more/10/2017/) why lesbian couples may have a higher divorce rate than other couples, and [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/12/15/same-sex-divorce-rate-not-as-low-as-it-seemed/?utm_term=.5bc13a4d9b9d), though disproving a ridiculously low rate of homosexual divorces in an earlier article, still mentions that the actual rate is **comparable** to hetero marriages. I guess it depends on the situation, but I can't be too sure here.\n\n&gt; \"Among women, 39.2 percent of the same-sex cohabitants and 21.7 percent of the opposite-sex cohabitants reported being raped, physically assaulted, and/or stalked by a marital/cohabiting partner at some time in their lifetime. Among men, the comparable figures are 23.1 percent and 7.4 percent (exhibit 8).\" https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles1/nij/181867.txt\n\nThis report actually has some interesting statistics regarding this, where the intro to the chapter says \"Results from these studies suggest that same-sex couples are about as violent as heterosexual couples.\" Also, these figures are kinda skewed as the report only states \"*co-inhabitants*\" instead of couples, which the reports finds a fallacy. Also, the report also examines the reports and finds that domestic abuse isn't a problem with sexuality, but with male-dominance of some sort, a different problem in it's entirety.\n\n&gt; \"Research demonstrates, Wardle maintains, that gay parents subject children to disproportionate risks; that children of gay parents are more apt to suffer confusion over their gender and sexual identities and are more likely to become homosexuals themselves; that homosexual parents are more sexually promiscuous than are heterosexual parents and are more likely to mo lest their own children; that children are at greater risk of losing a homosexual parent to AIDS, substance abuse, or suicide, and to suffer greater risks of depression and other emotional difficulties; that homosexual couples are more unstable and likely to separate; and that the social stigma and embarrassment of having a homosexual parent un fairly ostracizes children and hinders their relationships with peers.\" http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2657413.pdf\n\nI don't even need to click the link. Again, it's not a problem of being gay per se, but the **social stigma** as mentioned in the very quote you mentioned. If we educate people and remove this social stigma, these problems might be easier to deal with. Imagine if people didn't like you because you have blue eyes. It's not something you can help with, but everybody hates you the same.\n\nI appreciate your research into this, but your quotes are cherrypicked and fail to state the **reasons** for such problems in the LGBT community, reasons which I have provided to help those viewing this post understand LGBT people's problems better. :--)", "author": "TheStateOfIt", "created_utc": 1528289550, "score": -0.9991}, {"body": "It was anything and everything to stop TCB at all costs even if it is does look so amateurish, ridiculous and even laughable.

The 92-year-old powered back into Malaysian politics as Prime Minister after stepping down in 2003, leading an opposition coalition that toppled his former party.\n\nHe is fortunate, like the six persons featured in The Sunday Times Life article Young At Heart. Like the other five featured, I have led a relatively privileged life. We have been sustained by strong social networks, financial security, family support, reasonably good health and continuing education, and an intellectual curiosity about the world. We are the lucky ones and the pioneers of the oncoming \"silver tsunami\". We don't know how people are supposed to behave at 80 or 90 or 100, so we just do our own thing.\n\nBut there is an underside of ageing - a diversity of problems, needs, and responses that we as a society must tackle.\n\nA 2015 Tsao Foundation paper on elderly poverty noted that 60 per cent of the elderly population was poor in 2011. I thought I understood poverty, but I was not prepared for what I found when, a few years ago, I visited the Jalan Kukoh Housing Board estate. It is home to some 6,000 households, many of them elderly men and women living alone. Poverty was written on the faces of people in Jalan Kukoh.\n\nThe corridors of the rental flats were dark, dank and silent. The smell of decay was everywhere. Old men stumbled along, their eyes dull; their body language signalled despair and emotional deprivation. Corners of the buildings were enclosed by metal grilles to prevent them from becoming public toilets.\n\nThe people of Jalan Kukoh have been the subject of many studies since the 1970s - one may wonder if as study-subjects they have been stripped of some humanity. They were, in effect, living in exile in their own society.\n\nFortunately, in more recent years, a community of volunteers have intervened to support the children of the estate. At least the next generation would be helped out of their poverty and their sense of powerlessness by the generosity of volunteers. There is some hope there. But the poverty in Jalan Kukoh (and other such estates) is as much about powerlessness and exclusion, so manifestly evident in their physical isolation, as about low levels of income. It is as much a social, cultural and political reality as it is an economic one.\n\nWhen there is such rank poverty in a manifestly wealthy nation, one wonders if there is a lack of political will to address the causes of poverty and the isolation of the poor. Or is there some tendency to see poverty as the outcome of laziness and lack of ambition? Research has shown, however, that it is powerlessness that has trapped people in poverty.\nPORTRAITS OF AGEING\n\nMany people of my generation - I am 81 - lead quiet, stoic lives, dealing as best we can with a host of financial problems, afflictions and loneliness. The many pawnshops and money converters such as the ones in Ang Mo Kio, for instance, signal that life is a financial struggle for at least some of the residents of the estate.\n\nAs I live in an HDB estate, I am aware of how visible people's everyday lives are, especially of the old.\n\nThere was this old man, partially blind and very unstable on his feet, who wandered around the neighbourhood, sleeping wherever he could. His family didn't want him during the day and only allowed him home at night to sleep.\n\nTwo doors away lived an old woman with her husband and three sons. Slowly her sons disappeared. One of the sons told me that his mother was foul-mouthed and hard to live with. She was probably showing early symptoms of dementia.\n\nOne day, she had a fall, went into hospital and came back after weeks of therapy. She became even more difficult to live with and chased her husband away. She was alone.\n\nWhen neighbours checked on her, they found her flat in a shambles, cooking utensils and plates piled up in a sink that had not seen detergent for months. The bathrooms were black with grime. Dementia had taken hold. She was moved into a home where she died soon after.\n\nHow can people like these be helped to live and die in dignity? I don't know. I only have questions.\n\nIn a study, the National University Hospital's Department of Psychological Medicine found that nearly 21 per cent of those over 80 and 16 per cent of those in their mid to late 70s said that they were sad, lonely or in low spirits. In 2010, 41 people aged 75 and above killed themselves. By 2030, there will be an estimated 83,000 seniors living alone. Between 2011 and 2015, there was an average of about 415 deaths from suicides each year, of which an average of 116 involved persons aged 60 and above, according to an official government reply to a parliamentary question.\n\nWhen my neighbour Betty retired recently, she decided to move out of her brother's home and buy her own flat. She wanted her mother to live with her. But unfortunately, her 90-year-old mother had a fall and was hospitalised.\n\nEvery morning, Betty visited her mother at the hospital. She left her flat at eight in the morning and returned at night after her mother was asleep. After about six months, her mother died.\n\nFor the first time in her life, Betty was living alone. Driven by loneliness and a fear of being alone, she decided to move into a home for the elderly.\n\nMy friend Renee's father is 85 and mother 83. When her father showed signs of dementia, she placed him in a home. When she had him admitted five years ago, the charge was about $1,500 a month. Two years later, it went up to $2,700. This excludes charges for an ambulance when he needs to go to hospital for check-up and medication. She then moved him to a home in Johor Baru. In Singapore, from what I can gather from some websites, the charges for a place in a nursing home seem to average around $4,000 for a shared room and can go up to $7,000 for a single room.\n\nRenee worries about her own old age, as do I. She retires in two years and will have less financial resources to help her ageing parents.\n\nA few years ago, I met up with Lucy, an old friend. We talked about our golden years. How do you spend your time, I asked her. Oh, she said, I wake up late, get dressed, go out and walk around the malls. She has covered every mall in town and knows which foodcourt sells the best food. I wake up late too, I said. The day doesn't seem too long, that way.\n\nSome time after this, she rang me and asked for a loan of $2,500. She sounded quite desperate and promised to return the money. A couple of weeks later, she asked for a further $200, and every now and then she would ring and ask for $30 or $50. She didn't want to talk about it or ask for help, and I respected her privacy. I remember how dignified she has always been.\n\nI am overwhelmed by the complexity of the issues of isolation and poverty among the elderly. We desperately need to have a deep conversation about the values we hold as a society.\n\nOur sense of what it is to be human, to be a person, must be at the centre of this conversation.\n\nHow can our society ensure dignity and peace of mind in old age? How can we, a materially rich country, eliminate poverty? The assumption that the poor have a negative mindset and are lazy and lack ambition must be challenged.\n\nThis attitude prevents policymakers from addressing the underlying, concrete problems that cause this sense of disempowerment. The need to talk seriously about a pension scheme and a minimum wage is urgent.\n\nOccasional handouts, top-ups, seeking help from government agencies and other organisations are not enough. These do not contribute to our sense of dignity.\n\n\"Dignity is like clean air,\" writes Associate Professor Teo You Yenn in her book This Is What Inequality Looks Like. Dignity, she writes, \"is a sense of being valued, a feeling of being respected, a sensation of esteem, of self-worth\" in everyday life. It is a feeling \"that persists in the face of diverse and/or changing life circumstances\".\n\nCan we not aim for all of our people - especially the elderly who helped build this nation to its success today - to have this sense of dignity?\n\n\u2022 Constance Singam is a civil society activist who was president of women's rights group Aware.", "author": "Jammy_buttons", "created_utc": 1528417245, "score": -0.9976}, {"body": "Yup.

[...] For once I thought I am entitled to my own opinion and think a product is bad (despite other thinking is good).\"\n\nI'm sorry that there are commenters attacking your opinion. Perhaps a better way to phrase your experience would to say that you found menstrual cups *not very suitable* for your personal needs &amp;/or body type. Afterall, not everybody's body (&amp; even environmental circumstances) conform to the so-called \"norm\".  \n\nFor a menstrual cup to feel comfortable (or to feel like it's not there), it has to sit at the mid-point or lower section of the vaginal canal. The expanded cup should not be pressing against the cervix or its sides, but instead form a seal against the mid or lower vaginal wall. This [diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Menstrual_cup_inserted.png) shows where a correctly-inserted cup is located for women with a *typical* uterus (ie. tipped forwards &amp; lying over the bladder). \n\nDo you continue to feel the menstrual cup after it is properly inserted ? Or is it impossible to insert the cup fully, even when you are in a relaxed state of mind (ie. no psychological inhibitions regarding vaginal insertions) ? If yes, there is a possibility that you might have a shallow vagina.  \n\nA shallow vagina could be due to a [retroverted](http://www.feministmidwife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/retroverted-uterus.jpg) or [retroflexed](http://www.feministmidwife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/retroflexed-uterus.jpg) uterus, whereby the uterus is titled upwards or backwards respectively -- more info: [1 OBGyn.net](http://www.obgyn.net/hysterectomy/significance-tipped-uterus), [2 Victoria State Gov](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/retroverted-uterus). A \"retro\" uterus is not uncommon. Some 25% of women have a retroverted uterus, &amp; smaller percentage with a retroflexed uterus.  \n\nFor women with a \"retro\" uterus, if the degree of retroversion is not that serious, &amp; the cervix remains high enough within the vaginal canal, it is still possible to use a *small* menstrual cup w/o feeling extreme discomfort, although one may remain aware of its presence.  \n\nOn the other hand, a high degree of uterus retroversion can result in the cervix being located *very much lower* in the pelvis (ie. very close to the vagina entrance). This in turn results in a very shallow &amp; constricted vaginal canal.  In which case, even the smallest available menstrual cup would end up being where the (low) cervix is located, hence the discomfort.  \n\nAs such, women who are lucky enough to be able to use menstrual cups w/o discomfort should not discount the reality that there are some women who are *anatomically* unable to enjoy the benefits of menstrual cups.\n\nEDIT: Make 2 reference hyperlinks \"broader\" (as advised by FatFingerHelperBot), so that they are easier to click on mobile devices.", "author": "hairycactus", "created_utc": 1529450926, "score": 0.7393}, {"body": "wah [dude casts no shadow](https://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/35542626_10155714147859422_1518344795393622016_n.jpg). must be one hell of an elder vampire sia", "author": "kronograf", "created_utc": 1529466174, "score": -0.7783}, {"body": "Photoshop expert?

I looked at the World Bank's historical data\u00b9. A couple of observations:\n\n1. Singapore is always ahead. Even in the 1960s, its GDP per capita is close to double that of Malaysia.\n2. Singaporean growth exceeds 10&amp;#37; by the end of the 1970s; Malaysia's growth generally remains under 5&amp;#37; during this period, and jerk\u00b2 is approximately 0 over the same period.\n3. There's a plateau in the mid 70s, and Malaysia starts to catch up, but Singapore over the whole period still grows faster, and the gap is such that even around 1975, Singaporean GDP per capita is triple Malaysia's. Rapid growth in the 80s is actually roughly matched in proportional terms by growth in Malaysia; Singapore's head start makes it appear to overtake Malaysia significantly, and in absolute terms this is true.\n4. After a slight dip in the mid 80s, Singapore grows at close to 20&amp;#37; a year in some cases through to the mid 90s. Malaysia generally grows at closer to 10&amp;#37; a year; predictably, this causes the gap to increase to about five times Malaysia's GDP per capita in 1994.\n5. The 1997 crash hits Malaysia harder than Singapore in proportional terms; Singapore's is maintained, and even grows.\n6. Both don't really start to recover until 2001, when Singapore starts to grow extremely quickly again, at nearly 15&amp;#37; a year, until the recession. Malaysia has slightly lower rates of growth, but Singapore's initial advantage means that the gap appears to grow even larger. By the recession, the gap is still about five times Malaysia's GDP per capita.\n7. The recession causes growth to near zero, but it doesn't cause much contraction. Very fast growth between 2009 and 2011 is tempered by slow growth and a slight reduction of GDP per capita over the next few years. Malaysia, however, remains stagnant.\n\nSome meta-notes:\n\n1. Be more sceptical of short-term than long-term trends. Part of the growth from 2009 to 2011 was probably due to exchange rate fluctuations; what was measured was in USD, not SGD. The effective purchasing power of both is inflationarily affected in ways that cause short term distortions.\n2. I didn't use PPP because it's adjusted for the sorts of goods that Singapore does not primarily trade in, viz. agricultural and fairly simple consumer goods, not more expensive products.\n3. There's not really a single turning point; the increase in the difference from one of a factor of two to one of a factor of five occurs over two or three decades.\n\n\u00b9 [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2016&amp;locations=MY-SG&amp;start=1960](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?end=2016&amp;locations=MY-SG&amp;start=1960)\n\n\u00b2 that is, change in change. or growth in growth.", "author": "universitary", "created_utc": 1529796271, "score": 0.9833}, {"body": "&gt;Over the years, SRA and STB had tried various ways to breathe new life into the GSS.\n\n&gt;SRA is the main promoter for GSS.

About 200 participating brands dangled exclusive offers and discounts through the app.\n\n&gt;To mark the GSS\u2019 25th anniversary this year, the SRA has introduced two days \u2014 July 7 and August 8 \u2014 on which the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be absorbed by participating retailers.\n\n&gt;Such a sales tactic has been successfully employed in the past by department store Robinsons. \u00a0But this is the first time it has been introduced in the GSS.\n\n&gt;Other efforts this year include the addition of geofencing technology to the GoSpree app, which enables consumers to receive e-coupons for discounts if they are within a 5km radius of the participating merchants. From July 1, the app will also allow users to send the coupons to their friends by email or Facebook.\n\n&gt;An SRA spokesperson said more than 9,000 people have downloaded the GoSpree app this year, bringing the total user pool to around 43,000. Tourists make up one quarter of those who had downloaded the app.\n\n&gt;Courts Singapore is among the retailers which have come onboard the GoSpree app. Its country CEO Ben Tan said it is offering exclusive promotions via the app, with shoppers able to \u201cenjoy attractive discounts of up to 40 per cent on small and personal care appliances as well as cookware by downloading eCoupons on the app and presenting them at the cashier counter for redemption\u201d.\n\n&gt;However, some retailers including Benjamin Barker were uninterested. Mr Tan, its chief operating officer, felt the app\u2019s reach was \u201cstill very limited\u201d, and the additional point of sales \u2014 in return for what he felt were little returns \u2014 was cumbersome for a small outfit like theirs.\n\n&gt;\nFIXING THE GSS: WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE \r\nApart from piecemeal initiatives, some experts and retailers felt that a more fundamental review of the GSS concept was needed. Among other things, the organisers must be clear about the campaign\u2019s target audience \u2014 whether it is the tourists or the domestic consumers \u2014 and whether it wants to reach out to the younger, more tech savvy generation of shoppers or is content with getting the business of an older demographic, they pointed out.\n\n&gt;The recent focus on Chinese tourists for example does not resonate with retailers serving the domestic market, the experts and retailers noted. The seemingly old-school marketing efforts are also having a limited reach, they added.\n\n&gt;\u201cGSS was created 25 years ago. Up till today, we are still very unsure who the target demographic is,\u201d said Benjamin Barker\u2019s Mr Tan, who reiterated that his business focuses on the domestic market.\n\n&gt;\nJaren Ho, founder and creative director of Yacht 21. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY\n\n&gt;Ms Jaren Ho, 34, the founder of apparel brand Yacht 21, said the GSS was not doing enough to attract the millennials via social media such as Instagram.\r\n\u201cYou look at the crowd going to Art Box. GSS or not, people still want to shop, come out and spend money, but the concept needs to change. Renaming the whole thing might help. Or use another approach,\u201d said Ms Ho, who suggested taking a \u201cmore lifestyle approach\u201d.\n\n&gt;Mr Joshua Koh, who is the chief executive officer of local furniture firm Commune, said that should the GSS embrace its tourism focus, it should be made more holistic by involving the entertainment, hotel and food and beverage establishments as well \u2014 and not just clothing, furniture or appliance retailers for example.\n\nNO LONGER \u2018THE SALE WORTH WAITING FOR\u2019\r\nUltimately, the GSS needs to stand out from the other sales campaigns all-year round, if it wants to remain relevant. \u00a0\n\n&gt;When it was first started, the GSS was \u201cthe only season\u201d for great deals and discounts, said Benjamin Barker\u2019s Mr Tan. Ms Ho added: \u201cSingaporeans (grew up) knowing what is a GSS.\u201d\n\n&gt;That was a time when there were hardly any online competitors, said Mr Bernard Aw, principal economist at market research firm IHS Markit.\r\n\u201cWith fierce competition from online retailers now, it\u2019s harder for GSS to gain the prominence it once had,\u201d said Mr Aw.\n\n&gt;Other countries have also caught on and are providing stiff competition: The Malaysia Mega Sale, the Hong Kong Shopping Festival and the Amazing Thailand Grand Sale are all held during a similar period as the GSS, said Ms Wendy Low, who is the head of retail at Knight Frank.\n\n&gt;With consumers spoilt for choice, retailers are also coming up with their own strategies, with many turning to the online space.\n\n&gt;Apart from holding their own sales outside of the GSS period, some major retailers \u2014 including Robinsons and Metro \u2014 are cashing in on global shopping events such as Black Friday or Singles Day. \u00a0\n\n&gt;As a result, consumers hoping for the best deals during GSS are left disappointed.\r\n\u201cGiven strong regional competition and the rise of online shopping, the GSS can certainly benefit from a reinvention,\u201d said Courts Singapore\u2019s Mr Tan. \u201cThat said, it remains a signature event for both locals and tourists, who tend to bargain-hunt during the season.\u201d\n\nIF YOU CAN\u2019T BEAT\u2019EM, JOIN\u2019EM\r\nTo give the GSS a much-need publicity boost and renewed interest among today\u2019s Internet-savvy customers, the organisers could also leverage the reach of online retailers, some experts suggested.\n\n&gt;Lazada, for instance, held its first GSS sale in 2015, and generated the most buzz on the Internet then with daily deals on its mobile app, according to marketing technology company Amobee.\n\n&gt;This year, Lazada continued to offer sales under the GSS banner, and contrary to reports from physical stores, the e-retailer has seen a sharp increase in sales compared to last year.\n\n&gt;\u201cShoppers this year are increasingly browsing and purchasing via Lazada\u2019s app in comparison to previous GSS sale periods. This can be attributed to our new Shakin\u2019 Deals feature, where shoppers can shake their Lazada app to win exclusive vouchers,\u201d the e-retailer told TODAY. \u00a0\n\n&gt;In 2015, e-shopping service provider ezbuy started its annual \u201c65eday\u201d campaign which is held every year on June 5. \u201cWe introduced this (campaign) to commemorate Singapore as ezbuy\u2019s country of origin and create Singapore\u2019s first and largest global online shopping festival that customers can look forward to,\u201d the firm told TODAY.\n\n&gt;The sale, which was held just three days before this year\u2019s GSS official started, offered discounts of up to 90 per cent \u201cacross millions of products from various marketplaces\u201d. \u00a0\n\n&gt;The company also held sales from June 10 to 18 \u2014 coinciding with the start of the GSS this year \u2014 as part of its annual mid-year sale, where sellers offer 20 per cent to 50 per cent discounts.\n\n&gt;Ezbuy\u2019s largest sale, however, remains the Singles\u2019 Day sales where it sees \u201c50 to 100 times increase in sales\u201d.\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;Retailers are sitting up and taking notice. \u00a0Accordingly, they are adjusting their strategies.\n\n&gt;Courts Singapore\u2019s Mr Tan said that in recent years, the company has \u201cnoticed the rise in popularity of other shopping events such as Black Friday and Singles Day that play on the rise of e-commerce\u201d.\n\n&gt;As such, it has been \u201cdriving promotions during these signature shopping events over the years\u201d, he said.

There will always be problems, it is normal, even married couples have problems, but they can be resolved,\" Mr Mohamad told The Straits Times in an interview yesterday. \"So far, there is no problem that cannot be resolved between Malaysia and Singapore. We are good neighbours.\"\n\nReflecting the ups and downs in bilateral ties, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government at the end of last month dropped a high-profile international court case over its renewed claim on Pedra Branca. The case was revived in February last year by the previous Malaysian government.\n\nMr Mohamad, president of Parti Amanah Negara, said one avenue for the two countries to work together is by strengthening security cooperation in the entry lane to the Singapore Strait - near Middle Rocks and Pedra Branca - following a collision involving a US Navy ship last August that killed 10 sailors.\n\nJust south of the South China Sea, the waters there are a busy sea lane that links the East Asian economies with energy-producing nations in the Middle East and, farther on, the African and European countries.\n\n\"Security in the area needs to be beefed up by Malaysia and Singapore,\" Mr Mohamad said.\n\nAt present, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand conduct joint patrols along the Malacca Strait from the Andaman Sea down to the Singapore Strait and its entry point from the South China Sea.\n\nAmanah is one of the four component parties of Malaysia's ruling PH coalition, which came to power in the general election last month, landing Mr Mohamad his job as the new defence minister.\n\nAs he settles into the job, Mr Mohamad has said that he will look at rationalising the military's budget in line with the belt-tightening stance of the PH government, and the government is forming a committee to look into alleged past procurement scandals involving the Defence Ministry.\n\nHe said that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is visiting China soon, will raise with Beijing the subject of the presence of Chinese vessels, including fishing boats, in Malaysian waters.\n\n\"For us in the Ministry of Defence, we are concerned with the presence of China's vessels in Malaysia's exclusive economic zone. China must abide by international laws and (restrain) themselves to avoid any misjudgment that could lead to tension and conflict.\"\n\nDespite these incidents, he said that Malaysia would not deploy warships there.\n\n\"We will not deploy warships, we will not wage war with superpowers, (whether) China or the US. Maybe we will place small ships, like boats, to patrol the waters, and if there is a problem with China, I am certain it can be resolved with discussions.\n\n\"If we make a show of force, how far can our show of force go in facing China and the US? It is better for us to show our sovereignty, and for them to protect the region together, especially the South China Sea.\"\n\nOf the Defence Ministry's streamlining of its assets, Mr Mohamad said: \"We do not want too many types of ships, for example. We have 15 types now, we want to reduce it to five types. If we have too many types from too many different countries, we will face a problem with maintenance.\"\nFrom street protester to minister\n\nKUALA LUMPUR \u2022 An enduring picture of Defence Minister Mohamad Sabu was one showing him sleeping while wearing the yellow shirt of electoral reform group Bersih in 2015.\n\nNo bedroom picture this, as he was fast asleep in the middle of a road with a lorry parked beside him, while waiting for the protest to start.\n\nA big crowd-puller at opposition rallies and street demonstrations, the 64-year-old is adjusting to his new role as a Cabinet minister.\n\nMr Mohamad seemed an unlikely figure for the defence portfolio when his name was first announced.\n\nKnown for his fiery speeches laced with homespun jokes, he was deputy president of Parti Islam SeMalaysia, but left in 2015 after his group of progressive leaders lost in its internal polls.\n\nThese leaders formed Parti Amanah Negara, a moderate Islamic party that he heads. Amanah is one of the four parties that make up the ruling Pakatan Harapan coalition.\n\nIn a viral video last month, Mr Mohamad stopped while reading from a text at a defence function. He said that after 40 years of speaking off the cuff as an opposition leader, he must now, as a government leader, read from prepared speeches.\n\nThe crowd, including military generals, roared with laughter, and clapped loudly to encourage him.\n\nAsked how he felt when he clocked in on his first day at work last month, he said: \"Of course (I am) nervous, because you know, I am usually with the people, but now I have to follow certain rules and protocols.

The Member for Kebun Baru has given an exposition from the viewpoint of the NTUC, and I do not wish to cover the ground that he has already made. There is no doubt that we should be aware that there will be a problem of the aged in the years to come, whether in the year 1990 or the year 2000. But it is important, therefore, that we should try to divorce a proposition that has been put forward by the Minister for Health, trying to explain to us what the size of this problem will be and the means to solve this problem. \n\n\nUnfortunately, the Report of this Committee on the Problems of the Aged has tried to solve this complex problem by touching on the Central Provident Fund as if that were the only solution, very much the way that the Minister for Health went about trying to solve the problems of the sick by using Medisave and taking off 6% from the CPF to collect monies which is spent by patients in the hospitals. The reason for all this uneasiness on the problems of the aged is related to the CPF. The problems of the aged have been forgotten because you are touching people's savings. \n\n\nI related in the debate on Medisave how the Government could cover the cost of the entire operations of the Ministry of Health from revenue earned by the Ministry of Health plus the 2% payroll tax, without touching on savings. You have created a precedent. You have touched savings for Medisave. I abstained from the vote. Others have agreed. So the Minister for Health says, \"Well, I have got one nut. Now I can get two nuts. How do I solve the problems of the aged? There was no great opposition to touching the CPF. Now I shall solve the problems of the aged by dipping into the CPF.\" But here, he came across a hornets' nest. \n\n\nIt is because, Mr Speaker, the problem is that those who attempt to seek a solution to the problems of the aged are civil servants who draw pensions to which they do not pay anything. They get a gratuity, two-thirds, and pension, one-third. So it is quite easy then to handle other people's problems by touching their savings. Pensions do not come from savings. \n\n\nSupposing, if we did convert the entire cost of running the civil service on taxes and savings, I believe you would have a different report today. There are many countries that are facing this problem. It is not unique in Singapore. No political problem is new for Singapore. And this is a problem that has been encountered by bigger societies and bigger economies than ours. They have employed devious ways of how to allow those who are ageing to retire gracefully and in security without becoming a pauper. Why, in America, there is even a scheme in the private sector which permits a retiree to donate his entire savings to a company and he is posted to a village where he can retire until he dies. That is a very expensive village. It is not meant for those with small CPF savings. \n\n\nThis problem of touching the CPF should be related to the use of the CPF, the management of the CPF and the contribution of CPF. I have repeated, time and again, that the CPF, having risen now to 50% of wages, is becoming a vexatious burden, not only to the employee but also to the employer. The employer is now paying 25% of salary towards the CPF, plus 2% payroll tax, plus 4% Skills Development Fund. That makes 31% cost on payroll alone. \n\n\nOf course, if there is an increase in salary from NWC recommendations, all these taxes go up. The burden on the employee is that his take-home pay becomes less, and since his take-home pay becomes less it is an issue for union bargaining, (house-unions now) to bargain with the employer for more pay. The Minister for Finance is extremely concerned with the amount of money being locked into CPF, reducing the liquidity in commercial banks. I think that is a very genuine concern which, as the Minister for Finance, he ought to be very worried out. He should not allow his Minister for Health to dip into the CPF or to increase the CPF, because this is a social problem that is popping up. It must be thought out in breadth. We must have a vision which encompasses breadth. Do not have tunnel vision.

(From my own personal experience). If its hot there's a easy solution out there which is to switch on the air conditioner which actually exacerbates the problem as more electricity is being used. As such, there's no real incentive for people to be concerned with the root causes of what's causing warmer temperatures, because there's an easy band-aid out there.\n\nIf it were me, I'll charge a carbon tax equal to that of the cost needed to recapture the CO2 generated.

In particular, the requirement that fund-raisers have a written agreement with the charities before soliciting funds. The statement also urged donors to be discerning about such online appeals.\n\nBut TGC's co-founder Charles Tan, 33, who previously worked at financial services company Cantor Fitzgerald, said he believes his enterprise has abided by all relevant legislative requirements.\n\nTGC has written agreements with the four charities listed on its platform, he added. The charities are: Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Singapore, Alzheimer's Disease Association, Life Community Services Society and The Rice Company Limited.\n\nMr Tan started the enterprise with his wife Cao Xin Xin, also 33, who was working in investment banking. The couple are now running TGC full-time. Mr Tan said donors also have the option to donate to charities other than the four listed, adding that he does not believe this counts as soliciting for donations for the other charities.\n\nHe noted that organisations like the Singapore Children's Society have conducted similar charity raffles.\"We want people to get to a stage where they give unconditionally and volunteer their time and money, but we take the view that sometimes people need a nudge, so that's all we're trying to do.\"\n\nFor the first draw, donors can buy a T-shirt from the website for $20, to claim a ticket for the lucky draw. The prizes are worth more than $180,000 in total, including a new Mercedes-Benz CLA 180 Coupe which sells for about $160,888, and cash prizes ranging from $8 to $10,000, said the TGC.\n\nThe company plans to take a commission of about 5 to 10 per cent from each donation for subsequent draws, to help pay for the prizes and other operating costs.\n\nSome in the charity sector have reservations about the company's methods. Ideally, donors should be motivated by genuine care for the cause, said Mr Jeffrey Tan, a director at National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre.\n\n\"Our research shows that while big tempting prizes may garner a sudden influx of funds, it does not change the mindset of givers as the focus is on the prize rather than the impact they'll make,\" he added.\n\nSimilar efforts in the past have fallen out of favour, said Singapore Children's Society's chief executive Alfred Tan, who cited the National Kidney Foundation's (NKF) fund-raising efforts in the 2000s.\n\nNKF had also made use of lucky draws to bait donors with prizes like private apartments, but people protested against the idea of donating money for the prizes, he added.\n\nMr Alfred Tan said charity raffles are not a main staple of his organisation's fund-raising efforts now.\n\nThe charities on TGC's list, however, are supportive.\n\nMs Selina Sebastian, deputy executive director of SPCA Singapore said: \"For many years, people are used to the idea that giving has to come from the heart, and it's the kind of spirit that we want to inculcate too.

I am an adult man, married to a very sensible woman and working in an area very far from the \u201cproblem spots\u201d (politics, media, education). However, as a believer in democracy I\u2019m a bit worried.\n\n&gt;You see, I\u2019ve worked and lived in a couple of other European countries as well, and when I see how Sweden in some areas - gender-equality and immigration being the most obvious - fail miserably to have any kind of serious debate I actually do get worried. Not only because it\u2019s a sign of a failing democratic system but also because some of these issues may have rather significant effects for future generations. The Swedish establishment is more or less controlled by what would be considered extremists in comparable countries. Don\u2019t ask me why - this is one of the areas where Sweden\u2019s very elitist, even more so than the UK for example - but this means that even the merest hint of an objection to\u2026 for example, changing the education system, will result in smear campaigns or dropped grants instead of constructive debate. The result? No opposition. Which means no sobering checks and balances system. Which means just about anything can happen.\n\n&gt;The most obvious example in this regard is how Sweden has treated the immigration issue. Of course it\u2019s got little to do with gender-equality, but the process is the same:\n\n&gt;Sweden declares itself a moral super power, opening it\u2019s borders to the World and offering the most generous welfare services in the World to anyone who turns up. Anyone suggesting that might cause some problems get a swastika stamped across their forehead and is carted off from all public debate. Shitloads of people from the Third World turn up. Cracks begin to show in the beloved Swedish welfare system as very few of the newcomers are employable. A few voices suggest measures to control the situation - such as actually deporting those who are denied asylum. Out with Nazi stamp again - boom! Someone claims numbers are actually relevant - boom! Medical age testing of unaccompanied minors is suggested - boom! Without any debate at all Sweden takes 160 000 asylum seekers in one year - equalling roughly 5 million people from the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan turning up on the United States\u2019 doorstep! In a single year!\n\n&gt;Eventually Sweden panics and closes the border. And even now it\u2019s done as a \u201csecurity measure\u201d with no official intent to lower the number of immigrants. After taking the highest per capita number of asylum seekers in all of Europe for years Sweden is changed forever. And all of this without a real debate.\n\nNow, in most democratic countries the idea of changing the future of the nation without a broad debate would be thought of as bloody silly. But in Sweden - when the subject is one of those having almost a cult following among Swedish elites - it\u2019s done without batting an eyelid! And in my view, that is not a typical sign of a great democracy at work.\n\nLook at these clips. They\u2019re from a series of debates broadcast by Danish and Swedish state television a couple of years ago. It\u2019s not a Denmark vs Sweden debate as the participants (mainly mainstream politicians and journalists) all represent different views, but what I think is very clear is the difference in attitude towards what political debate really is! The Danes debate with more or less reasonable arguments, behaving like adults, and the Swedes instantly resort to the kind of childish smearing, name-calling and emotional outbursts that actually WORK when disqussing these subjects in Sweden!

Recently, the NCMP Leon Perera asked:\n\n&gt; To ask the Prime Minister in each of the past five years, what has been the bonus paid to Cabinet Ministers in terms of (i) the average total number of bonus months (ii) the highest total number of bonus months paid to an individual Minister and (iii) the lowest total number of bonus months paid to an individual Minister.\n\nInstead of replying with the exact figures to each question, the PM replied by giving some average figures for only one category of bonuses (namely the Performance Bonus) and told Perera to refer to the 2012 White Paper formulae and figure it out himself.\n\n---\n\n**We still don't know what exactly the PM (or any other minister) earned in total in 2017.**\n\nWe now have, for example, [The Online Citizen](https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/09/11/13-bonus-months-for-the-prime-minister-pm-lee-skirts-questions-filed-by-wp-ncmp-leon-perera-about-total-bonus-months-paid/) estimating that ministers received 11.85 months' bonus pay in 2017. If that figure holds for the PM whose base pay is $2.2M, then the PM would have earned a total of $2.2M \u00d7 (23.85/12) = **$4.3725M** in 2017.\n\nTOC also goes on to argue that the PM may have had 13 months' bonus, in which case he would have earned a total of $2.2M \u00d7 (25/12) = **$4.5833M** in 2017.\n\nNow, the \"Factually\" website will probably take a screenshot of my above remark and add a sensationalist and huge FALSE stamp to it. But instead of simply coming out and stating what exactly and precisely the PM made **in total** in 2017, it will merely vaguely state that he made $2.2M plus some National Bonus. It will also ask you to read the 2012 White Paper and work out for yourself what his National Bonus in 2017 was. (And this is exactly what TOC has attempted to do.)\n\nIt would seem, to me, an extraordinarily simple matter to produce a one or two page PDF or small spreadsheet file listing the precise total made by each and every minister in the last 5 years. Yet this is not done.\n\n---\n\n**\"The government is not upfront about how ministerial salaries are calculated.\"**\n\nHilariously, the \"Factually\" webpage debunks the above statement by offering the following \"reply\":\n\n &gt; Fact: This is false.

Steve Job's ability to make the right hardware and integrate with the appropriate software is what makes iPhone so disruptive. But as time goes and it seems like Apple lost their directions in terms of where their product is heading. There must be a golden ratio between price and productivity. As the prices of iPhones increase, people will start to ask whether is the comfort worth the price? If you buy a 2.6k phone and argue that you use it everyday, but if you have to add on iCloud storage, pay extra for phone insurance, change battery after a few years.... these little things add up. Eventually android will catch up. There will be a better brand providing better value per dollar. And this is where android phone makers benefit; every dollar Apple is not earning will go to them. As Apple loses more market share, they will start to add in more \"premium\" feature and charge a little more for said feature. \n\n\nAs for virus issues, I agree that a regular user would not be affected as easily as android users. Android allow users to install their own API (which is double edge. You can develop your own software and install it without going through app store, but at the same time its users are exposed to the same virus risk). But Apple is a single point of failure. Once their fundamental codes have a engineering flaw or logical error, it's much easier to expose the entire population to hackers. I believe there are examples to back what I just said as well. Sometimes the best protection is less protection. Being exposed to risks keeps you sharp, but at the same time less technologically savvy users are much more exposed. \n\n\nPre-smartphone days, nobody thought of how to make smartphones smarter. They are less keen to improve, less keen to think out of the box. Why fix something that isn't broken? There are smartphones running on android before pre-apple days but they were not user-friendly. The need to use stylus, mouse, hardclick keyboards on a small phone. Another reason why I loved Steve Job is because he loved thinking out of the box. His failures gave him colourful experiences which helped to shape Apple and it's past successes. We humans are lazy creatures and tend to take things as it is. User experience wasn't a term much used before the tech revolution happened. It's the whole experience that matters and Apple is losing not just the battle anymore and instead, the war. \n\n\nOne thing I have to disagree with you is because respective android phone makers they fundamentally uses the same android API, but they have to customise the UI Wizard for their own brand. Many of them add in their own bells and whistles which makes it worse because there are so much more bells and whistles instead! I've always hated android, just fyi. Because it is fundamentally flawed (Too many different brands adding their own flavour to the mix) compared to Apple. But at one point I gave up on Apple because there's not enough customisation. Now I'm at a happy place because I feel s8+ is a good enough phone (not a perfect OS, it's hardware are not perfect [stupid curve screens], but it's good enough for another few years). If it is 3 years or 4 years back, I'll probably swap s6 out for a iPhone. No doubt. \n\nI agree that brands like Samsung, Huawei and oppo doesn't really improve android. That's because they are running their own UI Wizard! Fundamentally they are the same java codes. Just different looks and feels. Google does a good job as well but they are a power house and phones are not their main domain. They are doing a good job because they have to. If they do not integrate the phone software properly, there will be a lot of legacy issues. They leverage a lot on their software integration in order to play the bigger game. To run the longer race. That is actually what a lot of the players are doing in order not to be eaten. Placing their eggs in separate baskets but at the same time improving the egg quality ;) which is the reason why Apple is still surviving. Their product eco lifecycle is good enough to still attract players despite their flaws. But when you have too many rats munching in your farm eventually you will lose all your produce.

It happens to pretty much everything we own, but technology and cars are especially prone to it. This is because we all go in search for the new and the best as new features and models emerge, meaning that the older stuff gets left in the dust and loses its financial worth.\n\nAlso from [tech.co](https://tech.co/iphone-smartphone-depreciation-2016-07), this:\n\n&gt;As with many computers, which are no longer sought after today, smartphone values suffer from the introduction of newer, faster technology coming to market. Consumers see little value in holding on to slower technology, when they could be operating at much higher speeds and acquiring smartphones that sport the latest bells and whistles. As a result, the perception of demand for last generation smartphone products tends to decline as soon as something more impressive is available for consumer purchase.\n\nNot sure where you got your stats for S7's depreciation as well as iPhone 7, but if you're asking me why S7 \"devalues\" twice as quickly as iPhone 7, it is probably due to the fact that S7 depreciated faster because it couldn't support the latest software *as well as a S8 or even S9.* iPhone 7 is valued twice as much as an S7 because it can still run the latest iOS at probably the same speed it did when it was first released.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What's the point of comparing hardware to hardware or software to software?

If you really want to make change, raise this issue to people who don\u2019t care about local politics and inform them about its importance or talk to those who are on the fence on the issue. 377A is reflective of a society that is against the LGBT community.

If successful, each owner would have  received $2.5 million to $2.8 million, up from $2 million to $2.3  million.\n\n\"We were at 74 per cent for the last few months. More than 480 units  had signed.

According to the URA Master Plan 2014, the site  is zoned for residential use with a gross plot ratio of 1.6.\n\nAnalysts were not surprised at Ivory Heights' steep asking price,  given its large land area and location near the Jurong East and Chinese  Garden MRT stations and the proposed HSR terminus.\n\n \n\n\"But it's a case of 'never the twain shall meet' for now. You can't  ask for a high price when the unique selling point - the HSR project -  is absent for the moment,\" said Mr Alan Cheong, senior director of  research and consultancy at Savills Singapore.\n\nLast month, Singapore and Malaysia agreed to defer the HSR project for two years.\n\nA bigger issue is higher land acquisition costs and potential  penalties for developers following the latest cooling measures, Mr  Cheong said.\n\nEffective July 6, a developer has to pay a non-remissible additional  buyer's stamp duty of 5 per cent and a remissible 25 per cent if it does  not complete and sell the entire project within five years of buying  the site.\n\nIvory Heights' failed attempt could be a harbinger of what is to come  for other mega sites undergoing the collective sale process, analysts  say. Next up is the 660-unit Pine Grove, whose deadline to get the 80  per cent mandate expires on Oct 28. To date, 78 per cent of owners have  consented to a reserve price of $1.72 billion.\n\nHuttons Asia's head of investment sales Terence Lian, who is  marketing Pine Grove, said: \"The 2 per cent who are holding out should  come to terms with current market conditions and not harp on getting a  higher reserve price, so as not to end up like Ivory Heights, which  lapsed prematurely.\"", "author": "Jammy_buttons", "created_utc": 1538353138, "score": -0.6596}, {"body": " \n\nAsk a class of six-year-olds who a \"stranger\" is and the following  responses are what you may get: \"A stranger is a bad guy.\" \"Someone who  wears black and looks fierce.\" \"A stranger is someone who will put you  into a bag and take you away!\"\n\nParents are adept at teaching their children about the concept of  stranger danger. When it comes to sexual abuse, however, this notion  actually does more harm than good.\n\nThe experiences of victims of sexual abuse have shown that it is most  frequently committed by people who are familiar to the children. The  Sunday Times article in August, \"When home is where the sex abuse is,  for kids\", highlighted a sharp increase in the number of allegations of  child sexual abuse locally.\n\nLast year, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)  investigated 181 alleged child sexual abuse cases, compared with 107  cases the year before. In the past few months, a slew of sexual abuse  cases brought to court involved perpetrators who were supposed to be  trusted persons or caregivers of the victims.\n\nThe recent report released by the Penal Code Review Committee  proposes more safeguards in Singapore's legislation to protect  vulnerable groups, especially children, from harm. Some of its  recommendations address crimes of sexual abuse. It is laudable that the  country's law is keeping up with the times and addressing the rising  threats to children and young persons where sexual abuse is concerned.  But while the law can prosecute offenders, it does not do much for  prevention.\n\nIt is timely to concurrently assess what more should be done to equip  children with protective behaviours to reduce the incidence of child  sexual abuse.\n\n \n\nIn 2000, the Singapore Children's Society started a sexual abuse  prevention programme, KidzLive: I Can Protect Myself, for primary school  children.\n\nWe shifted the programme's focus to pre-schoolers in 2011 as the lack  of such education is even more pronounced among the younger age group.  Moreover, statistics released by the MSF last year showed that almost 40  per cent of all the cases of child abuse investigated from 2014 to 2016  involved children below seven years old.\n\nOur programme teaches five-and six-year-old children to differentiate  between good and bad touches, and to tell a trusted adult if someone  behaves in sexually inappropriate ways towards them.\n\nOne of the key messages we convey through the programme is that  familiar people can also harm them. Even so, we have also realised that  children need more guidance in carrying out the protective strategies  taught, particularly in telling a trusted adult should sexual abuse  happen.\n\nIn addition, as much as we emphasise to children to tell their  trusted adults about uncomfortable secrets, if the adults themselves are  ill-prepared or unwilling to listen, then it will still come to naught.\n\nIn the course of our work, we have encountered a number of sexual  abuse concerns arising from kindergarten-level children who were touched  inappropriately on their private body parts.\n\nThere was the boy who insisted that a scenario card depicting an  uncle touching a boy on his penis is a good touch. When asked why, he  said his father, as well as his father's friend, had done the same thing  to him and they were just \"playing\". A girl claimed that her father had  touched her on her breasts; while another boy said his grandfather had  touched his groin area.\n\nIncreasingly, we have also had children telling us they watched  videos where other people's private body parts were shown. Are these  incidents accidental exposures or a potential perpetrator at work? It is  hard to tell.\n\nSome of these concerns were flagged to the Early Childhood  Development Agency (ECDA) and Child Protective Service (CPS) for  follow-up. In a few cases, statutory interventions were needed to ensure  the safety of the child.\n\nOn the ground, we have come across educators who have also tried to  wish away suspected sexual abuse concerns for various reasons.\n\nSome educators needed to be absolutely sure that abuse had occurred  before consulting the ECDA or CPS, for fear of upsetting their  relationship with the child's family. Others were wary of having to  manage competing demands, due to the time and resources needed for the  record-keeping of suspected concerns.\n\nWe believe that these educators care about the children and feel  responsible towards them, but that they are just not sufficiently  equipped with the practical know-how to handle such concerns.\n\n#### HAVING EDUCATORS ON BOARD\n\nShortly after we reached out to pre-schoolers through the KidzLive  programme, we realised that it was not enough to target the children  alone.\n\nWe developed a booklet containing information on child sexual abuse  for parents, educators and other caregivers. We also started conducting  talks and training for parents and educators, in which we highlighted  key child sexual development milestones, ways to support children in  sexuality education, and how to handle suspected abuse concerns.\n\nSince 2011, the KidzLive programme has reached out to over 10,200  children in more than 320 pre-schools, and we have trained more than 230  educators. However, considering that there are close to 2,000  pre-schools in Singapore, we have been able to reach only a small  percentage of children and centres.\n\nWe were very encouraged when the ECDA approved our teachers' training  course as a Continuing Professional Development course for early  childhood educators last year. However, we believe that more can be done  to develop a sustainable approach in protecting and supporting our  children.\n\n#### INTEGRATING SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION INTO THE PRE-SCHOOL CURRICULUM\n\nOur ultimate goal is to see sexual abuse prevention education being  integrated into the pre-school curriculum, for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022Child sexual abuse is often shrouded in mystery. With younger  victims, perpetrators take advantage of the fact that these children do  not even know what is happening is wrong - because nobody had taught  them so. Having sexual abuse prevention as part of our children's  education will remove the taboo of discussing the topic openly. It will  also help to clear any misconceptions that children may have (think:  stranger danger). Such education is not as daunting as people may  imagine it to be. It is simply about giving accurate information to  young children for them to be able to know when things are not right,  and what they can do to stop it.\n\n\u2022With younger children, teachers are often the next most trusted  people besides their parents. In cases of intra-familial abuse where  family members try to cover up the abuse, educators provide an  additional lifeline to victims so that they may receive help sooner.  Integrating sexual abuse prevention messages into the curriculum will  lead to a more systematic way of providing educators with enhanced  training to handle the teaching of body safety skills and to manage  suspected sexual abuse concerns. Prevention education from a young age  will help to build a child's core skills for life. With the formation of  the National Institute of Early Childhood Development to streamline the  training curricula of pre-school educators, this is an opportune  juncture for the early childhood sector to make the commitment to ensure  every child's right to a well-rounded education to safeguard his  well-being. Just like the direction that Singapore's law is heading, its  education also needs to keep up with the changing times.\n\n**\u2022Alfred Tan is chief executive of the Singapore Children's Society.**", "author": "Jammy_buttons", "created_utc": 1538353250, "score": -0.998}, {"body": "im not v sure about these eateries (have never eaten at these places before) but seems good ... u can check for reviews online\n\n**JADE at FULLERTON**\n- all-indoors (i suppose)\n- up to 120 guests\n- https://www.fullertonhotels.com/the-fullerton-hotel/weddings.html\n- DETAILS: https://www.fullertonhotels.com/uploads/9/8/1/8/98182264/weddings_at_jade_2018-19.pdf\n\n**EMPRESS at the ACM**\n- by the Singapore river\n- indoors &amp; outdoors\n- DETAILS: http://empress.com.sg/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Empress-Wedding-Booklet-16Jul18-WEB.pdf", "author": "BT-Reddit", "created_utc": 1538353872, "score": 0.5218}, {"body": "There are plenty of militant LGBT SJWs right here in reddit. \n\nI said this a number of times before.

On October 9th Singapore\u2019s high court found him guilty of \u201cscandalising the judiciary\u201d. He was not the only rabble-rouser. John Tan, a politician from the opposition Singapore Democratic Party, had observed in May: \u201cBy charging Jolovan for scandalising the judiciary, the [Attorney-General\u2019s Chambers] only confirms what he said was true.\u201d Mr Tan was convicted of the same crime.

The amendments came into force last October. One effect was to broaden the definition of scandalising the judiciary. Previously actions that posed a \u201creal risk\u201d of undermining public confidence in the courts were considered a crime. Now a mere \u201crisk\u201d will do. The changes also made the penalties more severe and expanded the scope of the rules to include social-media posts.\n&gt;\n&gt;Even before being strengthened the contempt-of-court law got plenty of use. In 2008 three men (including Mr Tan) were convicted for turning up at the Supreme Court wearing T-shirts depicting kangaroos in judges\u2019 robes. Later a British journalist was sentenced to six weeks in prison for writing a critical book about the death penalty in Singapore. Cartoonists and bloggers have also been prosecuted.

However, this will not compensate for the increasing energy demand from the industry and buildings sectors, which will result in rising emissions.\n\nSingapore\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emissions target of a 36% reduction of emissions intensity below 2005 levels by 2030 is very weak compared to currently implemented policies, which, according to our analysis, will lead to emissions in 2030 of 60 MtCO2e, or a 123% increase above 1994 levels.

However, Singapore\u2019s energy mix is likely to remain very uniform in the future, resulting in a prolonged dependence on fossil-fuels.\n\nOutside the power generation sector, Singapore\u2019s mitigation efforts almost exclusively consist of measures aimed at further improving energy-efficiency through programmes like Green Mark standards for buildings, public transport, fuel efficiency standards, home appliance efficiency standards, industrial energy efficiency, and waste management.", "author": "xolpxolpxolp", "created_utc": 1539379232, "score": 0.9883}, {"body": "whats the name of those round small pillar things at bus stops? the one with the stony stuff on top. just dont know what its called. https://citygreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/jurong-bus-station.jpg ", "author": "theNEWgoodgoat", "created_utc": 1539419751, "score": 0.0516}, {"body": "The general trend is poor[ correlation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/10/06/a-new-report-suggests-a-fundamental-idea-behind-ceo-pay-could-be-broken/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.0df08c6304f6) between CEO pay and company performance.

Singh asked Low whether he recalled that FMSS was incorporated on 15 May 2011 and at that time HTC was now part of AHTC. Low said yes.\n\nSingh asked whether HTC had its own employees and how many were there.\n\nLow said yes but he could not remember exactly, about 14 or 20.\n\nSingh asked if CPG took over the management of Hougang there was a risk the employees might lose their jobs.\n\nLow said yes but he would have to negotiate with CPG if they wanted to take over Hougang.\n\nSingh asked whether Low entered into negotiation with CPG.\n\nLow said no.\n\nSingh asked why not.\n\nLow answered that because on the first meeting with CPG, they already said they wanted out, \u201cwhat is there to negotiate?\u201d\n\nSingh asked so because someone said they want out means out?\n\nLow went, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nSingh asked what then about the contract, how could it be as simple as when you enter into contract with someone, they say they change their mind, and thus they are out.\n\nLow answered legally perhaps, he would this to the lawyers, but \u2026\n\nSingh cut Low off, saying that it appeared to him that because CPG was out simply because they said they wanted out.\n\nLow said no and wanted to say more.\n\nSingh said, \u201cwhat is there to negotiate?\u201d, \u201cthey wanted out\u201d, that Mr Low said that twice.\n\nLow explained at length. Low said that he said that because Singh said if CPG took over Hougang, the staff would lose their jobs.

The article you quoted seems to talk about the 7 claims he approved and the award of the contract to his company separately. \n\nThe \"claims\" part means he bought some things for the GRO using his own money. He then \"claimed\" the money back from the GRO. He shouldn't have approved this himself, but he did. If he indeed bought the items for the GRO, which I believe is verifiable, the problem with this is more the process than the claim.\n\nThe fact he was involved in the evaluation process is more serious. After all, there is a conflict of interest in this case. What I would be interested in is how many other people were involved in awarding the contract to his company. The article states that there was at least one other person who also has a conflict of interest, but misses out the important detail that is how many of those involved in the evaluation didn't have a conflict of interest. It also doesn't state the instrument by which the project was awarded (i.e. was a quotation called etc.). I would assume a quotation was called though as that is the norm and waiving the calling of quotation is likely to have been flagged in this case (like it had been flagged for WP's case). Once the vendor is appointed the approval of payments is actually kind of secondary (you've already entered the contract saying you will pay X amount).\n\nSo the next question is which is more serious? I would say that both cases are serious. The rationale behind calling a tender/quotation is to have transparency and fairness in the procurement process. The idea is for everyone interested to bid and to compete on equal grounds. Skipping it is pretty bad. Skipping it when there is potential conflict of interest is really really bad. But setting up an evaluation process that ends up as a farce because you are not seriously considering anyone else is not much better. You just happen to be playing by the rules a bit more. \n\nThere is a key difference though. In the case of the CCC Chairman it may be possible evaluate the different bids and see whether the Chairman's company's bid had been fair and whether an independent party is likely to make the same decision to award the contract to that company. So a 3rd party could investigate to see if the evaluation was a farce. And if it wasn't they could make the decision to not sue the person. Of course I also find the investigation process problematic (it should have been more clearly independent) but I'm not sure of the practicality of that.\n\nIn WP's case this just doesn't seem to be possible.

But what I do know is that the CCC Chairman's case is much more straightforward. And that could be a key difference in deciding if the case goes to court. That's the main argument and you didn't actually have anything to say about that.\n\nIn any case, there isn't an accusation of corruption in either of the cases, just of mismanagement. That means the amount of money being mismanaged is also a deciding factor here.

And ok I misquoted the WP amount, but it being higher actually doesn't look bad for my case. Nobody in their right minds will go to court over $32,000 when their lawyer fees could go up to as high as $600,000. \n\nAnd the fact of the matter is, if a quotation had been called (which I assume it has been or it would have been highlighted) it makes it much simpler to assess damages. You compare the awarded bid against the others which bidded. For WP's case there is no comparison because no tender was called. They waived it. And they waived it for seemingly no good reason in an instance where there could be conflict of interest. This makes the potential damages they incur go up to $33 million. I'm not saying these are actual damages, just possible potential damages. But with that amount spending $600,000 on legal fees looks much more rational.\n\nThe case being straightforward refers to the fact that the damages would have been a lot more straightforward to assess. I don't see why this is contentious. Having 2 (or however many other) bids vs having no other bids (because you didn't allow them) sets up the cases differently. \n\nThat the CCC Chairman case is not more transparent is a concern.

They will be readily available for online and person-to-person use, including making micro-payments.\n\n\"And of course, we expect it to be cheap and safe, protected against criminals and prying eyes,\" she added.\n\nThis evolution cannot be ignored. She said if the majority of people in a country adopt digital forms of money, \"the infrastructure for cash would deteriorate, leaving those in the periphery behind\".\n\nCalling on governments to take the lead, Ms Lagarde said central banks can allay concerns people may have about the rise of cryptocurrencies by issuing their own digital currency. The more commonly traded cryptocurrencies now include bitcoin, ethereum and dogecoin.\n\nPrivate firms, she worries, may under-invest in security in the nascent days of cryptocurrencies. Trust in digital currencies would be eroded in the event of a private system breakdown.\n\n\"Resilience may also suffer. With only a few links in the payment chain, the system may stop working if one of these links breaks. Think about a cyber attack, a glitch, bankruptcy, or a firm's withdrawal from the local market,\" she added.\n\nMs Lagarde said that central banks can design digital currencies in which the users' identities are authenticated by customers adhering to due diligence procedures, and by recording the transactions.\n\n\"But identities would not be disclosed to third parties or governments unless required by law,\" she added. The veil of anonymity can be lifted if the authorities suspect money laundering or terrorism financing activities, for instance.\n\nShe said central banks do not have to go at it on their own, but can work with private firms to come up with solutions that allow financial innovation to flourish.\n\n\"Banks and other financial firms, including start-ups, could manage the digital currency,\" she said, adding that central banks can then focus on back-end settlement, which is their comparative advantage.\n\n\"This is public-private partnership at its best,\" Ms Lagarde added.\n\nMr Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in March this year that the Republic's central bank does not have a compelling argument to issue digital currency as digital payment networks are already conducting electronic transactions here.\n\nDuring the event on Wednesday, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the same audience that the fintech revolution has benefited the South Asian country as India makes strides in digital banking, biometrics and connectivity.\n\nHe said that digital banking through mobile phones has allowed \"millions (to)... receive insurance in their (bank) accounts and have access to pension in old age\".\n\n\"A student can get scholarship (money) directly (transferred) to her account.

For instance, it could be a dream  co-working space and part of it could be a very successful hotel,\" she  said.\n\nDP Architects, which designed the complex in the 1960s, was appointed  by the collective-sale committee as consultant architect in August to  understand the development potential of the project.\n\nMs Chan said its existing mixed-use infrastructure could easily  complement potential development plans, citing a recently restored  government building turned hotel in Hong Kong - The Murray - as an  example of successful adaptive reuse of a 1960s structure.\n\nThe US$1 billion (S$1.4 billion) renovation of the 25-storey  modernist tower resulted in the conversion of office spaces into hotel  rooms, while its classic facade was retained. The developer invited the  original architect, 90-year-old Ron Phillips, to be a consultant.\n\nMs Chan said Golden Mile Complex may appeal to the younger generation  because of its \"iconic form\". \"Consumers today demand more unique  experiences out of the places they inhabit. Leveraging a place with a  strong authentic story is a powerful way to stand out among the noise of  invented narratives.\"\n\n \n\nEven though the existing building's footprint occupies a significant  portion of the site, there is still room for expansion and sensitive  intervention, she said.\n\nBut until last month, the word \"conservation\" had not crossed the minds of some owners of the apartments and business units.\n\nET&amp;Co senior director of investment advisory Swee Shou Fern said  that after they achieved the 80 per cent requisite to \"go en bloc\", they  approached Urban Redevelopment Authority to consult it on the planning  parameters for an Outline Application as a redevelopment site.\n\nMs Swee said: \"That was when the URA brought up the subject of  conservation and suggested that the collective-sale committee appoint an  architect to advise on the planning application for the conservation of  Golden Mile Complex.\"\n\nMs Irene Loi, who is the chairman of the collective-sale committee,  said: \"The importance of the building was impressed upon us. We had no  inkling of conservation prior to the meeting with URA.\"\n\nShe said the owners had the initial mindset that the site would be redeveloped completely.\n\nShe added that the wish of the sales committee now is for a buyer  \"who can embrace Golden Mile Complex and revitalise the development via  an adaptive reuse and bring it worldwide fame\".\n\nDespite the positive sentiments expressed, gaining conservation status would present several challenges.\n\n \n\nApart from upgrading the complex to meet today's technical standards,  the developer will have to manage the financial impact of the longer  development period that conservation projects entail, Ms Chan said.\n\nThe tender exercise, with a reserve price of $800 million, will close on Jan 30.\n\nThe industry is keenly watching the case of Golden Mile Complex,  which is tackling the issue of conservation amid a bid to sell it en  bloc.\n\nCalling it a litmus test, Ms Chan noted that the fates of many  post-independence buildings are coming to a reckoning now. \"How we deal  with this will chart what we do in the future.\"\n\nA Singapore Heritage Society position paper on the subject advocated  planning incentives for developers and building owners, such as offering  greater bonus gross floor area and more flexible re-zoning options.\n\nThe heritage community hopes the challenges will not put off  stakeholders. Architectural photographer Darren Soh recalled  conservation efforts in the 1980s and 1990s, when the authorities  engaged \"hundreds of individual stakeholders and owners when they  conserved whole districts of shophouses in Chinatown and Little India\".\n\n\"It must have been a tedious exercise but the Government was  convinced that the shophouses needed saving.

I mean, the entire Iraq war that destroyed the country of Iraq and killed more than half a million people was literally based on fake news propagated by the US and British governments, and then more or less supported, or at least, not seriously challenged by the Western mainstream media agencies.\n\nWith social media and the internet, your everyday citizen or journalist-wannabe can also participate in the propagation of fake (and real) news! And of course, since people are flawed, are prone to bouts of laziness, carelessness, stupidity, malice, inability to be perfect, etc, there will inevitably be cases where fake news is published.\n\nThose who demand fake news laws and regulations are simply insisting that only the government is allowed to determine what is fake news or not, asking the authorities to step in to tell them how to think, what sources to read,  how to evaluate news items, etc.\n\nPersonally, i prefer a society that is free and open (which means everyone is free to propagate fake and real news instead of just a selected group), that is allowed to mature and learn how to be skeptical and gradually develop a relative immunity to fake news, instead of a society that asks and relies on the government to protect them from the horrors of fake news. Of course, the government's authority is ultimately in the hands of the people, so if people clamor for the government to tell them what to read, how to think, etc, then I guess we do get the government we deserve.\n\nCertainly, the ability of the everyday man to propagate fake (and real) news does have drawbacks. But i think the benefits of a free and open society are clearly far greater because everyone is free and able to check and balance each other. The recent example of the overworked hawker  demonstrates this. The overworked hawker story may have been fake, but NTUC Foodfare were able to clarify the story. And when mainstream media print out false or misleading stories about the opposition, whilst previously the opposition had little way to clarify or respond, they can now do so, which I think greatly explains why mainstream media have been fairer in their treatment of the opposition. And what if the overworked hawker story was indeed true, but mainstream media simply decided it was not worth printing?

When Foodfare refuses to release this info before demanding taking down of articles and throwing defamation suit, are they not ridiculous?\n\nToday Newspaper's article say the party being sued want Foodfare to back up their counter claims with evidence. This is why a panel of independent journalists and experts is necessary. When both side claims to have the truth, who decides which is correct and which is not so?\n\nI trust neither side. Both have something to gain from making interpretations favouring themselves. I would rather an independent panel investigate it. I would gladly pay another 1% GST for this. At least it's fair and ensure that the real truth will be upheld and not a narrative pushed by whatever side with the means to enforce their narrative. \n\nSadly, with ardent supporters like you, this will never happen. Sure, suppress all the fake news. Suppress that few bad news without enough solid evidence to bring it to light also! Let our people suffer the yoke of bad corporate practices, and hope there are more KF Seetoh around to have access to more proofs to help the oppressed. \n\nEdit: I'm viewing Foodfare as a corporate entity and trusting that a hypothetical government appointed fake news panel is reliable and impartial.

After the plaintiff proves the elements of defamation, the burden then shifts to the defendant to prove that the statement is not defamatory because it is true. In this matter, should The Independent manage to prove that **all** their allegations in their article are true, then NTUC will fail in their suit for defamation. It is as simple as that. \n\nThe reason why you often see defamation cases decided in favour of the Government is because the defamatory statements that were made were simply *not true*. Therefore, your claim of, \"The results are often disastrous for the defendant,\" really holds no weight because they are simply being held responsible for their actions. \n\nIn fact, there are many other defences to defamation available, and they are all applicable to defamation suits in Singapore. If a defendant is found guilty of making a defamatory statement, it is often the case that their statements were wholly unjustified and false.\n\nFreedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.

I don't want this to be the alternative options for journalists to get info so they won't be sued. \n\nBut, the point here is, Foodfare counterclaimed with proof being their word and issued lawyers letters to takedown the article and sued for defamation.

There's a perfectly reasonable middle ground to be achieved. \n\n&gt; Lacking Due diligence or bad journalism or not, Foodfare is crossing some red line by suing opposition based only on their word.\n\nSuing is perfectly within their rights. Foodfare suing =/= Foodfare autowin. Evidence will be reviewed in court to see if Foodfare's case has any merit.

Mothership interviewed the stall owner's daughter and published her side accordingly as a response to Foodfare. What's fake about it? They reported it factually. Their tone was neutral. They did not sensationalise the headline to mislead readers.\n\nIf anything, it proves that anti-fake news laws are effective in curbing fake news and poor journalism. Any dispute, go to court to settle in public for all to see who's guilty of wrongdoing. \n\n&gt; Violating the privacy of the interviewees by expecting them to surrender all evidence related to the case for you to write on?\n\nHow is this a violation of privacy wtf.

I expect them to find out within their means.\n\nFinally something I can agree with. I've never once said ~~TOC~~ The Independent is guilty or that their article was poorly researched. In fact, they were the ones who refused to take down the articles when Foodfare asked them, which means they believe they did no wrong and are willing to fight for their case in a court of law. I'm waiting for the results first before talking prematurely about whether anti-fake news laws are good for SG or not (that was your original claim btw, that suing is somehow 'too much' when it's perfectly within Foodfare's rights to do so if they believe they've been defamed).\n\nHowever, if their best efforts yield inconclusive evidence, should they really publish the article just for the sake of it? I'd rather they continue to build their case precisely so that they can stand in court if they get sued by giants. Otherwise, even if they don't get sued, readers who are capable of critical thinking won't believe them. \n\nJust to be clear, my issue is with the numerous logical fallacies made in your original comment where you said: \n\n1. Fake news is bad but when the aggrieved party attempts to seek justice in court, it is somehow 'too much'. \n2. \"Bad-sounding\" facts are necessary for positive change, with no consideration for whether those claims need to be backed up with proof.\n3. Getting carried away and babbling about some false dystopian future when this legal case has only begun.\n\nThink about it this way. If people are allowed to make damaging claims against you and then brush it off with a simple 'oh sorry', you're gonna take all that unnecessary damage for nothing. They get away scot-free and you're left spending all your energy and time salvaging your destroyed reputation. That's what the anti fake news laws are for. \n\nFreedom of speech doesn't mean you get to say whatever you want with no repercussions.

There is no  meaning to democracy if Malaysia is governed by elite-based  politicking,\" wrote Datuk Seri Anwar's daughter Nurul Izzah on the eve  of her shock resignation as PKR vice-president on Monday.\n\nBut what were proponents of the New Malaysia expecting when, in 2016,  Tun Mahathir Mohamad had given fair warning by making a comeback via  Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM)?\n\nHis new party is a near facsimile both in name and substance of Umno,  where the long-serving former premier reigned supreme for 22 years.  PPBM then joined PH, and Dr Mahathir became its chairman and candidate  for prime minister in place of Mr Anwar, who was then in jail.\n\n\"It was bad enough when Pakatan Harapan made an alliance with the  unrepentant former autocrat, but now that Mahathir has been made the  'top dog' of the coalition, it is the biggest betrayal of the Reformasi  Movement yet,\" wrote former Democratic Action Party (DAP) lawmaker Kua  Kia Soong, a leading human rights activist who was jailed for 15 months  without trial in the 1987 Operation Lalang during Dr Mahathir's first  administration.\n\nLest we forget, the Reformasi was sparked in 1998 when Dr Mahathir  sacked his then deputy Anwar from government, before the latter was  jailed on a trumped-up charge of sodomy which was later overturned.\n\nThe movement saw widespread street protests calling for Dr Mahathir's  resignation on grounds of corruption, cronyism and abuse of power that  was increasingly being centralised under him.\n\nEven after stepping down in 2003, Dr Mahathir continued to pull the  strings, helping bring down his successor Abdullah Badawi in 2009 with a  steady stream of criticism.\n\n#### COLD POLITICAL CALCULATIONS\n\nBut when Dr Mahathir quit Umno in an escalating battle with the next  PM, Najib Razak, over the 1MDB scandal, sentiments in the opposition  ranks began to shift. The DAP and PKR, for all their reformist  credentials, wanted him on board. Never mind past grievances, because  putting an end to the Najib regime was top priority, and Dr Mahathir was  the only man who could defeat his own protege.\n\nThey rightly saw that he not only had the political standing to take  on the Umno juggernaut but also a mastery of the skills necessary to  manage Malaysia's often befuddling matrix of interests, influences and  issues.\n\nPH wanted Dr Mahathir, so now they have him, warts and all.\n\nHe delivered the election with cold political calculation and shrewd  pugilistic tactics. So why the surprise and disappointment when he uses  the same to secure himself in power?\n\nToday, with PPBM having won just 13 of PH's 121 parliamentary seats  at the election, Dr Mahathir finds his administration under threat by a  Malay Muslim right wing intent on stoking anger and anxiety within the  majority community with claims that the government is being controlled  by Chinese, liberals and foreign agents.\n\nUmno - which won four times the number of seats as PPBM in the May  general election - and Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) spearheaded a  pro-Malay rally two weeks ago. It drew over 50,000 people to the streets  of Kuala Lumpur, in an event reminiscent of the kind of protests Umno  used to face while previously in power.\n\nStung by the Umno-PAS claim that his government was selling out the  Malay majority, Dr Mahathir was not the sort to sit on his hands in  self-pity. Instead, the inevitable reprisal was swift and brutal, even  as he mockingly said \"thanks to the one million who gathered\" to  celebrate his decision not to ratify the UN racial equality accord.\n\nFirst came the disclosure that the Muslim pilgrimage fund Tabung Haji  (TH) was short RM9 billion (S$3 billion) under Umno's rule. This  embarrassed both his accusers as PAS had repeatedly said in the past  that it was satisfied with the responses by the BN government to  accusations of mismanagement of funds, including those involving the TH.\n\nNext, came the sudden exit of 11 MPs from Umno, including practically  the entire Sabah chapter which was founded under Dr Mahathir in 1996.  One of those who left, former minister Hamzah Zainudin, said more than  two dozen other Umno MPs have pledged support for the 93-year-old  premier.", "author": "Jammy_buttons", "created_utc": 1545177302, "score": -0.9882}, {"body": "Like allllllll opposition party?", "author": "leo-g", "created_utc": 1545181891, "score": 0.6369}, {"body": "He lives opp the block at 179.

Quite a lot is missed out so Id be really surprised if they manage to spin the Bicentennial narrative into something people would feel for. Although in recent National Day Parades the director have done a decent job on shining more light onto parts of SG History/Myths/Lore we dont usually learn about ie Badang\n\nHonestly an issue that I want to hear discussed is the 99-year lease problem. Currently there is not really any \"solution\" and the ramifications are speculative after the 99year lease ends. At the moment SERS is not guaranteed, and other than that, there is no compensation for when leases run out. It could be argued that the 99year lease was known beforehand, but the government has been saying things like \"HDB is a nest egg for retirement needs\". Which clearly, if there is no compensation when the lease expires, is just a load of horseshit. An entire generation of Singaporeans might be screwed. This isnt limited to just HDB owners. Some condominuims are also prone to the 99year lease issues. Many of which were previously available at a relatively lower price decades ago. \n\nThere is an argument to be made that leases need to exist so properties dont get passed on to the next generation making a wealth gap more noticeable, however leases dont prevent this altogether. It only prevents a specific generation of owners from profitting from selling the property. Inflation of prices have been astronomical and Im sure some next-gen owners have profited from it already. Not really sure what to make of it but to me the lease didnt exactly accomplish what it set out to do very well.\n\nBudget is also an interesting issue. Because looking at just government expanditure doesnt give you the whole picture. Revenue from taxes and other government owned companies need to be considered as well. For example. With the GST changes. There are changes to redistrubition as well, with increased amounts of GST vouchers for the lower income group. If it makes life harder for them, its a pretty dumb move. But if there is little to positive change, then its a good thing. So far the information available suggests a minor positive change, but that ignores the fact that the starting position isnt exactly sufficient in the first place imo. HDB and MSF have also been starting a new programme whereby lower income families are helped more in depth by providing sort of a \"mentor\" or helper, so help is more targeted. But that comes at the cost of less families being helped because of resource constraints.\n\nAlso, with large infrastructure projects like desalination plants going on, we will see how the the budget is changed. This year was already a surprise to many, because for the first time in ages less was spent on healthcate than the year before, and suddenly transport got a big boon. Probably next year transport budget wont be so much and more will be spent on welfare and healthcare. One thing in particular Id like to see changed is FAS in schools. Transport fees for kids who cant afford it should be subsidised completely, instead of just a proportion. When kids are forced to beg at the mosque on Fridays instead of going to school because they dont have money to take the bus, something is wrong.\n\nAnd as someone else has mentioned, increasing costs of necessities will be big as well, especially with the Hawker Centre issues this year. Something needs to be changed. The most direct solution to most would just be to lower rent tbh. Issues about competitiveness exist but hey priorities right\n\nCabinet reshuffle will be really exciting actually. Including next gen of potential MPs during the next GE\n\nAHTC is also one to watch. Without the 3 of them opposition is laughable.\n\nAnd lastly, cooperation with ASEAN. Lately were seeing more progress post 2000s than the decades of dancing around each other and being a No Action Talk Only talkshop for the region.
